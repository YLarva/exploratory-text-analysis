"BART","Mom and Dad have been smooching again. Homer enters in an impeccably tailored three-piece suit, massaging his scalp. His hair is parted in the middle and slicked straight back. He checks his reflection in the oven door, licks his fingers and straightens out his eyebrow hair.","7F02   SIMPSON AND DELILAH","2"
"BART","Well, as Mrs. Krabappel already mentioned, the name of the book that I read was ""Treasure Island"".","7F03   BART GETS AN F","5"
"BART","It's about these pirates. Pirates who wear patches over their eyes... and shiny gold teeth... and parrots on their shoulders...","7F03   BART GETS AN F","5"
"BART","And the pirates live on an island. But not just any island. It's an island filled with many, many different treasures... hence the title, Treasure Island. Did I mention this book was written by a man named Robert Louis Stevenson,  the famous author of ""Kidnapped?""","7F03   BART GETS AN F","4"
"BART","So in conclusion, on the Simpsons' scale of ten, ten being the highest, I give this book... a nine. Bart writes a big ""9"" on the board.","7F03   BART GETS AN F","5"
"BART","Why certainly. The name of the pirate would be one... Bluebeard.","7F03   BART GETS AN F","3"
"BART","All right, one more hour and we hit the books.","7F03   BART GETS AN F","6"
"BART","Hey man, what's the big idea? You covered up my paper. Bart walks over to the refrigerator and pulls the test off the door. We see that it was covering up a yellow, dog- eared drawing of a CAT next to a tree -- Bart's sole contribution to the door. It is signed ""Bart - lst Grade.""","7F03   BART GETS AN F","5"

"BART","Here you go, Mrs. Krabappel. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised. Krabappel pulls out her red pen and begins to grade it.","7F03   BART GETS AN F","3"
"BART","Look, you can't squeeze blood from a turnip. Why do you want me to say?! I'm dumb, okay? You think I'm happy about it?","7F03   BART GETS AN F","7"
"BART","What! You can't hold me back. I'll do better, I promise.","7F03   BART GETS AN F","8"
"BART","No, I mean it. You can't hold me back. I swear I'm gonna do better. Look at my eyes. See the sincerity, see the conviction, see the fear. As God as my","7F03   BART GETS AN F","7"
"BART","So they told me this was my final warning. Absolutely no more chances. Either I shape up on the next test or they are going to hold me back.","7F03   BART GETS AN F","1"
"BART","No, they really mean it this time. What am I gonna do?","7F03   BART GETS AN F","1"
"BART","Otto, you know I respect you. I mean you always let us throw stuff at cars and try to tip the bus on sharp turns... oTTo Hey man, I was there myself once. What's in your head, little man?","7F03   BART GETS AN F","3"
"BART","Well, I've been failing a lot of tests recently. otto Yuh huh.","7F03   BART GETS AN F","1"
"BART","And now they tell me that if I don't shape up they are going to hold me back in the fourth grade. otto That's it? Hey, relax, man. It's not","7F03   BART GETS AN F","1"
"BART","Hey, Martin... are you deaf? I said little help! Throw me the ball,","7F03   BART GETS AN F","3"
"BART","I need you to help me get a passing grade.","7F03   BART GETS AN F","3"
"BART","I mean I'll make it so that the other kids don't laugh at you so much.","7F03   BART GETS AN F","3"
"BART","Oh, yeah.  I guess it would be over there. Bart points to a corner where something resembling a desk is located. It is covered with candy wrappers, laser guns and small boxes of ammunition. Martin shakes his head.","7F03   BART GETS AN F","4"
"BART","Only geeks sit in the front seat. From now on you sit in the back row.","7F03   BART GETS AN F","4"
"BART","Because if you sit in the front, people can see the back of your head. You're a prime target for paper clips bouncing off your skull and spitballs dripping down your neck.","7F03   BART GETS AN F","5"
"BART","Great, Martin. Now the big test is tomorrow. What do you say we...","7F03   BART GETS AN F","3"
"BART","This is hopeless. I guess if you don't know history you're doomed to repeat the fourth grade. He SIGHS heavily and looks up at the stars. He crosses to the bed, gets down on his knees. Unseen by him, Lisa watches from the doorway.","7F03   BART GETS AN F","8"
"BART","Well, old timer... I guess this is the end of the road. I know I haven't been a decent, normal kid. But if I have to go to school tomorrow, I'll fail the test and be held back. I just need one more day to study. I need your help.","7F03   BART GETS AN F","1"
"BART","A teacher's strike, a power failure, a blizzard. Anything that'll cancel school tomorrow. I know it's asking a lot, but if anyone can do it, you can.","7F03   BART GETS AN F","6"
"BART","My God, she's right. What was I thinking of? I've asked for a miracle and now I've received it. For this I will study. Study as I've never studied before.","7F03   BART GETS AN F","6"
"BART","I'm not missing anything. Frozen earlobes, snowballs down the back of the neck, trudging up that stupid sled hill over and over again... how good could it be? Bart OPENS his window shade and looks outside.","7F03   BART GETS AN F","8"
"BART","Hey! Maybe just one snowball. He OPENS the window and is about to step out as he is hit in the face with a snowball. Martin approaches packing another one.","7F03   BART GETS AN F","5"
"BART","Do you want to be held back a grade? Concentrate.","7F03   BART GETS AN F","1"
"BART","No, you don't understand. I really tried this time. I really tried.","7F03   BART GETS AN F","1"
"BART","You know... 1754, the famous defeat to the French... Mrs. Krabappel looks up the statistic in her textbook.","7F03   BART GETS AN F","6"
"BART","Yeah, well that and a dime will get you a cup of coffee.","7F03   BART GETS AN F","5"
"BART","I got a D minus. I got a D minus. Look out fifth grade, here I come.","7F03   BART GETS AN F","1"
"BART","Come on man, do it! Do the blood thing! Come on, do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Lisa is talking to another wall in the house.","7F04   TREEHOUSE OF HORROR","5"
"BART","Well that last story was just a warm-up for this  macabre tale, which I call, ""Hungry Are The Damned.""","7F04   TREEHOUSE OF HORROR","8"
"BART","Yeah, like when you look at ""Friday The 13th, Part I,"" it's pretty tame by","7F04   TREEHOUSE OF HORROR","8"
"BART","I guess I'll have no trouble getting to sleep tonight. The kids exit the treehouse. We follow them out and down the ladder. They do not see Homer who is sitting on a tree branch looking petrified and BREATHING HEAVILY.","7F04   TREEHOUSE OF HORROR","1"
"BART","How 'bout if we just come back to the only bus in the lot?","7F05   DANCIN HOMER","5"
"BART","What? Aren't we going to see any washed-up major leaguers?","7F05   DANCIN HOMER","3"
"BART","Oh, wow -- there's Flash Bailor! I gotta get his autograph! He used to be a star!","7F05   DANCIN HOMER","3"
"BART","Lousy, washed up, broken down... old tub of guts... who does...","7F05   DANCIN HOMER","8"
"BART","Yes!!! Bart holds the ball up in his glove. Homer WHACKS the glove. The ball falls into Burns' glove. A thrilled Burns examines his prize.","7F05   DANCIN HOMER","5"
"BART","Well, I'11 still be here in spirit. Whenever a kid flunks a test, I'll be there. Whenever there's a window broken and no one knows who did it, I'll be there. Whenever a doorbell rings and somebody goes to get it and nobody's there, I'll be there. And whenever someone's passing out garlic gum to his unsuspecting friends, I'll be there.","7F05   DANCIN HOMER","1"

"BART","It's an honor, Lance. How are you feeling? Lance HUFFS and PUFFS, sweats and strains, as he struggles to lift his thumb to the ""thumbs-up"" position. He finally accomplishes this task in obvious agony. A loud CRACK is heard.","7F06   BART THE DAREDEVIL","3"
"BART","Hey, man, you can tell me not to do it, but there's no way you can watch me twenty-four hours a day. And the minute your back is turned, I'm grabbing my skateboard and heading for the gorge. Bart storms off to his room.","7F06   BART THE DAREDEVIL","8"
"BART","I've got to, Dad. I know I can do it.","7F06   BART THE DAREDEVIL","8"
"BART","No, Dad, you'll never make it. It's too windy, and the rocks are slippery, and sixty-three feet is a lot farther","7F06   BART THE DAREDEVIL","2"

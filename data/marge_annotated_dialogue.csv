"MARGE","And you know what else I like about the wee hours of the morn? This is our time to be together.

"MARGE","I can't tell you how chagrined we are about all of this.","7G01   SOME ENCHANTED EVENING","7"

"MARGE","We could look this ""id"" thing up in the dictionary.","7G02   BART THE GENIUS","5"
"MARGE","I think it's under the short leg of the couch. Homer takes the dictionary out from under the couch, stopping at the fruit bowl to get himself a banana on the way back. He starts to hand the dictionary to Marge, but Lisa grabs it away, opens it, and reads from it.","7G02   BART THE GENIUS","5"

"MARGE","But Homer, how long are we supposed to sit here and listen to you badmouth us to the Man upstairs?","7G04   THERE'S NO DISGRACE LIKE HOME","2"
"MARGE","They're having a conversation. They actually enjoy talking to each other.","7G04   THERE'S NO DISGRACE LIKE HOME","8"
"MARGE","Gee, Homer, are you sure this is the right thing to do?","7G04   THERE'S NO DISGRACE LIKE HOME","2"
"MARGE","Excuse me, dear. Shouldn't we be heading down to the pawn shop to get our TV back?","7G04   THERE'S NO DISGRACE LIKE HOME","4"

"MARGE","Well, Bart, I hope you're going straight to the principal about this.","7G05   BART THE GENERAL","8"
"MARGE","Bart, instead of fighting, why don't you try a little understanding?","7G05   BART THE GENERAL","8"
"MARGE","This bully friend of yours... Is hea little on the chunky side?","7G05   BART THE GENERAL","3"
"MARGE","And I'll bet he doesn't do well in his studies either.","7G05   BART THE GENERAL","3"
"MARGE","Huh huh. And I'll bet he's not all that attractive and doesn't make friends easily. That's why he lashes out at the world.","7G05   BART THE GENERAL","3"
"MARGE","So tomorrow, instead of bickering with this boy, talk to him. You'll be surprised how far a little understanding will go.","7G05   BART THE GENERAL","3"
"MARGE","Oh Homer, you'd lose your head if it weren't securely fastened to your neck. Homer GROANS in frustration.","7G06   MOANING LISA","2"
"MARGE","I'm sorry, everybody. I don't know how to break this to you all, but I've only got two cupcakes for the three of you.","7G06   MOANING LISA","7"
"MARGE","Thank you, Lisa. Just for being so nice, I'll give you an extra celery stick. Lisa SIGHS. Marge hands out the lunches.","7G06   MOANING LISA","2"
"MARGE","But they sent a note from school. Marge holds out note for Homer to read.","7G06   MOANING LISA","4"
"MARGE","Lisa, Honey, why don't we go upstairs and I'll draw you a nice hot bath? That helps me when I feel sad.","7G06   MOANING LISA","2"
"MARGE","Come on, come on. We were worried about you.  Nothing personal. I just fear the unfamiliar. Lisa gets in the car. Murphy starts PLAYING the SAXOPHONE. Lisa waves to him from the back seat of the car. Murphy waves back as he continues to WAIL away.","7G06   MOANING LISA","7"
"MARGE","Do you think you're being nice enough to your sister, Bart?","7G06   MOANING LISA","2"
"MARGE","Okay, Bart, you don't have to say it, but you do have to have a loving attitude. Be nice to your sister.","7G06   MOANING LISA","2"
"MARGE","Go on, Bart. No time like the present. Marge shoos Bart out the door.","7G06   MOANING LISA","2"
"MARGE","Now Lisa, listen to me. This is important. I want you to smile today.","7G06   MOANING LISA","2"
"MARGE","Well, it doesn't matter how you feel inside, you know. It's what shows up on the surface that counts. That's what my mother taught me. Take all your bad feelings and push them down, all the way down, past your knees, until you're almost walking on them. And then you'll fit in, and you'll be invited to parties, and boys will like you... and happiness will follow. Lisa attempts a small smile.","7G06   MOANING LISA","7"
"MARGE","Lisa, I apologize to you. I was wrong. I take it all back. Always be yourself. You want to be sad, honey, be sad. We'll ride it out with you. And when you get finished feeling sad, we'll still be there. From now on, let me do the smiling for both of us.","7G06   MOANING LISA","7"
"MARGE","Now calm down, Homer. Lisa has an idea that she thinks would be fun for the whole family.","7G06   MOANING LISA","2"
"MARGE","Very nice, Maggie. And Lisa you look lovely. Bart, assume the position.","7G07   THE TELLTALE HEAD","2"
"MARGE","Homer, why should I feel like a traffic cop every Sunday morning when I'm just trying to get a little goodness into the family.","7G07   THE TELLTALE HEAD","7"
"MARGE","Homer! Were you planning on sitting in the car till the game was over?","7G07   THE TELLTALE HEAD","2"
"MARGE","It's because of your irreverent attitude that Bart thinks he can sneak headphones into Sunday school.","7G07   THE TELLTALE HEAD","2"
"MARGE","Homer, you embarrassed us in front of the whole congregation, and today's sermon was one you should have really listened to.","7G07   THE TELLTALE HEAD","6"
"MARGE","No! Look, I don't want to talk about this any more in front of the kids. Lisa, Bart, what did you two learn in Sunday school today?","7G07   THE TELLTALE HEAD","2"
"MARGE","I know what those movies are like. Killing innocent people, eating human flesh.  You just get a lot of bad ideas.","7G07   THE TELLTALE HEAD","8"
"MARGE","It's a statue of the trailblazing founder of our town","7G07   THE TELLTALE HEAD","3"
"MARGE","Go on, Lisa. We've all got to be brave just like Jebediah when he killed that bear. Lisa sadly gets up and follows Bart out the door. Marge","7G07   THE TELLTALE HEAD","3"
"MARGE","A little? How's a boy supposed to learn right from wrong with the example you set? You bet on football games.","7G07   THE TELLTALE HEAD","2"
"MARGE","Putting the head back doesn't make things right, Bart. You're going to have to do some community service.","7G07   THE TELLTALE HEAD","8"
"MARGE","Well... okay. But I am not going to clean any fish.","7G09   THE CALL OF THE SIMPSONS","5"
"MARGE","We all are, dear, but your father says there's nothing to worry about.","7G09   THE CALL OF THE SIMPSONS","2"
"MARGE","Oh, I don't think they'll be gone long and she's in good hands, Lisa.","7G09   THE CALL OF THE SIMPSONS","8"
"MARGE","Oh, I don't think we're going to die, honey. But, on a totally different subject, is there anything you've always wanted to ask me or tell me but never got the chance to?","7G09   THE CALL OF THE SIMPSONS","8"
"MARGE","I'm sure they're just fine. After all, we built a fire and we don't know anything about nature. Imagine what your father, an experienced woodsman, has done.","7G09   THE CALL OF THE SIMPSONS","2"
"MARGE","I don't understand. What's this all about? Well, I suppose pork chops are his favorite.","7G09   THE CALL OF THE SIMPSONS","5"
"MARGE","You're not a blimp, Homer. You're my big cuddly teddy bear. Marge hugs Homer as he exercises,","7G10   HOMER'S NIGHT OUT","2"
"MARGE","Stop it, you two, and put on some nice clothes. Since it's just the four of us tonight, we're having dinner at the Rusty Barnacle.","7G10   HOMER'S NIGHT OUT","2"
"MARGE","Oh, Bart.  Excuse me, sir. The party next door seems to be a little raucous. Could you please ask them to quiet down a little bit, please?","7G10   HOMER'S NIGHT OUT","2"
"MARGE","Okay, but don't dawdle. Your food will get cold. Bart MOANS, gets up and leaves the table.","7G10   HOMER'S NIGHT OUT","5"
"MARGE","Homer, I don't even want to look at you right now. Marge goes to the door and opens it.","7G10   HOMER'S NIGHT OUT","8"
"MARGE","My suggestion is for you to sleep in the filth you created.","7G10   HOMER'S NIGHT OUT","8"
"MARGE","I've been thinking, Homer, and you know what bothers me the most about this whole thing? You taught Bart a very","7G10   HOMER'S NIGHT OUT","7"
"MARGE","Yes he does, Homer. And when he sees you treating women as objects, he's going to think that it's okay. You owe your son better than that, Homer.","7G10   HOMER'S NIGHT OUT","8"
"MARGE","Well, I think you should take Bart to meet this exotic belly-person. I want him to see that she's a real human being with real thoughts and real feelings. I want Bart to see you apologize for the way you treated her.","7G10   HOMER'S NIGHT OUT","8"
"MARGE","Well Homer and I had a lovely dining experience at Chez Pierre... or the Rusty Barnacle is","7G11   LIFE ON THE FAST LANE","4"
"MARGE","But this occasion is already so special if we made it any more special, we might end up making it less special.","7G11   LIFE ON THE FAST LANE","6"

"MARGE","You can't take it back. You had your name engraved on it.","7G11   LIFE ON THE FAST LANE","5"
"MARGE","I'm keeping it and I'm going to use it. Thank you for the present, Homer.","7G11   LIFE ON THE FAST LANE","5"
"MARGE","I don't see what he's doing that's so different from what I'm","7G11   LIFE ON THE FAST LANE","8"
"MARGE","Oh, no no. Homer is ny... ball's name. I'm Marge. Jacques places his hand on hers, which is on the illuminated scoring table, and runs the tips of his fingers over it.","7G11   LIFE ON THE FAST LANE","2"
"MARGE","No... no thank you, Mr... uh... (LOOKS AT THE NAME ON HIS BALL)... Brunswick.","7G11   LIFE ON THE FAST LANE","3"
"MARGE","Why, you're a very good teacher. Marge's face is flushed with triumph. A few strands of her hair are dangling in front of her eyes. She brushes them aside, girlishly. They flop back. Jacques reaches up,","7G11   LIFE ON THE FAST LANE","8"
"MARGE","Oh dear. I didn't realize there was so much to this game. What do you charge","7G11   LIFE ON THE FAST LANE","8"
"MARGE","Mmm-hmm. But I think I'1l do much better tomorrow night.","7G11   LIFE ON THE FAST LANE","6"
"MARGE","Oh Jacques! It fits. You got it in my size and it has my name on it. It's really for me.","7G11   LIFE ON THE FAST LANE","3"
"MARGE","Here you go, kids. Special lunches. Lots of good things for growing bodies and some treats just for fun. She hands them the bags, which are very heavy.","7G11   LIFE ON THE FAST LANE","2"

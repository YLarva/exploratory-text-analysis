INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - LISA'S BEDROOM - MORNING 
LISA is sleeping. The clock radio CLICKS to 7:00 and the 
radio plays the end of "MONSTER MASH." Lisa wakes up and 
starts to get dressed. 
MARTY (V.0.) 
Doin' the Monster Mash with you on this 
beautiful Valentine's Day. 
BILL (V.0.) 
Marty, why did you play that song 
today? There must be thousands of love 
songs. 
MARTY (V.O.) 
(COVERING) Well, it's, it's kind of a 
love song. All the monsters, enjoying 
each other's company... dancing... 
holding their evil in check. 
BILL (V.0.) 
You played the wrong record, didn't 


you?

MARTY (V.O.) 
(BEAT, QUIETLY) Why are you doing this 
to me? 
Over the preceding, Lisa goes through her morning ritual. 
She opens her closet where she has a wide variety of pretty 
dresses in all colors and sizes. She chooses her standard 
red dress. On the inside of the closet door are a wide 
variety of necklaces -- peace medallion, small cross, sea- 
shell necklace, etc. She puts her hand to her chin and 
thinks a beat before settling on her standard pearl 
necklace. Lisa turns off the radio after Marty's last line 
and exits.

(GIVES A LITTLE WAVE) Yoo hoo! 
MOE 
Oh, God, no. 
INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - KITCHEN 


MARGE gives HOMER a plate with "I Love You" spelled out in 
bacon strips. The "o's" are fried eggs. 


MARGE 
And this is for my Huggy Bug in honor 
of this special day. 


Homer looks panicky. 


9F13 FINAL DELIVERY 7/24/92 4. 


HOMER'S BRAIN (V.O.) 
"Special Day?" Oh,. what have I 
forgotten now? Now, don't panic... Is 
it Bacon Day? No, that's crazy talk... 
She's getting impatient, take a stab at 
it. 

HOMER 
Happy... Valentine's Day! 

MARGE 
Ah, thank you, dear. 

HOMER

MARGE) It's upstairs on the second 
floor of our house. I'1l just go get 
it. 
Homer exits. Marge, Bart, Lisa, and MAGGIE eye each other 
silently as we hear the following: Homer CLUMPING up the 
stairs and opening a CREAKY window. He GRUNTS as he climbs 
onto the drain pipe, then YELLS as it rips away from the 
house. 
HOMER (0.S.) 
(SCREAMS) 


We see Homer and the drain pipe fall past the window and 
hit the ground with a CRASH. 


INT. KWIK-E-MART - DAY SCENE 4 
Homer runs in. 
HOMER 
Apu, you gotta help me! I need a 
valentine's gift for my wife. 
APU 
(COYLY) Perhaps this might be 
appropriate. 
Apu holds up a heart-shaped box of candy. 
HOMER 


Yes! You saved my life. How much? 


9F13 FINAL DELIVERY 7/24/92 6.

He SLAMS down some cash. After a beat -- 


HOMER (CONT'D) 


Uh, give me a lottery ticket... and 
that Jaguar key chain... and a bumper 
sticker. 

APU

MISS HOOVER 
Not just yet, Janey. First, we're

LISA 
Isn't that just pointless busywork? 
MISS HOOVER 
Bullseye. Get cracking. 
RALPH raises his hand. 
MISS HOOVER (CONT'D) 
Yes, Ralph. 
RALPH 
My parents won't let me use scissors. 
The kids LAUGH. 
MISS HOOVER 
The children are right to laugh at you, 
Ralph. These things couldn't cut 
butter. 


She repeatedly hacks at her arm with a pair of kiddy 
scissors. 


MISS HOOVER (CONT'D)

hearts, which reads "EAT ME" and "KISS OFF."

Well let me tell you something, 
Valentine's Day is no joke...

Lisa finds an extra valentine, quickly scribbles on it, and 
puts it in his mailbox. 


LISA (CONT'D)

touched. Itchy leaves and Scratchy proudly displays his 
heart on a knick knack shelf. He sits down to read the

Ah, sweet pity. Where would my love 
life have been without it?

WIGGUM 
Son, I know just how you feel. You got 
a great little girl and the world's

RALPH 
No, Dad, she made a fool out of me. 
WIGGUM 
(CONSIDERS) Heyyy... Come to think of 
it, she did. (MENACINGLY) Well, she 
didn't reckon with the awesome power of 
the chief of police. 
Wiggum PATS his chest. 
WIGGUM (CONT'D) 
Now, where did I put my badge? Hey! 
That duck's got it.

chair. Ralph is standing with his back to her, staring 
pensively into the fire. 
LISA 
Dear, dear George Washington. Can this 
liberty you dream of be worth all this 
bloodshed? 
Ralph doesn't answer. Lisa starts to panic. 
LISA (CONT'D) 
(AD-LIBBING) Well, can it? 


Ralph wheels around fiercely. He is a surprisingly good 
actor. 


RALPH 
(PASSIONATELY) Dear madam. Would you 
put a price on the air we breathe, or 
the Providence that sustains us?

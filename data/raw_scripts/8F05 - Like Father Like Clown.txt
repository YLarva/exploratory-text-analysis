ACT ONE 


FADE IN: 
INT. KRUSTY THE CLOWN SHOW - DAY 
It is the very end of the show. KRUSTY is doing an axe- 
throwing exhibition with SIDESHOW MEL in an Ed Ames type 
outline. There are several axes embedded behind him 
including one in the curtain and one under his crotch. 
Krusty is getting ready to throw the last one. 
KRUSTY 
I hold in my hand the final axe. 
The AUDIENCE CHEERS & APPLAUDS WILDLY. Krusty reacts. 
SFX: DRUMROLL 
Krusty throws the axe at Sideshow Mel; the axe tumbles 
wrong and the handle hits Mel in the forehead with a KLUNK, 
knocking him out. Mel slumps down but is still pinned to 
the board by axes. 
The audience CHEERS. 
KRUSTY (CONT’D) 
Uh-oh. Let’s get a doctor out here! 


A CLOWN DOCTOR with a spinning hypno wheel reflector and a 
medical bag full of saws runs out. 


KRUSTY (CONT’D) 
No, a real Doctor. 


The clown doctor dejectedly exits and a real DOCTOR attends 
to Mel.

KRUSTY (CONT’D) 
Well, kids, that’s all the time we have 
for today. 


The band starts PLAYING. It is like the closing theme to 
Saturday Night Live, including the trademark SAXOPHONE. * 


KRUSTY (CONT’D) 
I’d like to thank Sideshow Mel, 
Corporal Punishment, Tina Ballerina, 
oh, and from "Knots Landing" Miss Donna 
Mills. Oh, she was a sport. 
Behind Krusty we see a woozy MEL being held up by CORPORAL 
PUNISHMENT, a FAT WOMAN in a tutu and DONNA MILLS waving. 
KRUSTY nods to the BAND LEADER who PLAYS the opening 
strains to the Krusty Closing theme. 
KRUSTY (CONT’D) 
(SINGING) We’ve had lots and lots and 
lots and lots and lots of fun/ but now 
the time has come... to go/ if this old 
clown was found dead in his bed 
tomorrow/ I’d be in heaven still doing 
this show. 
Krusty tugs his ear. 
KRUSTY (CONT’D) 
(SPOKEN) See you some other time! 
Krusty LAUGHS as the end theme plays. The kids CHEER. As 
soon as the red light on the camera goes out, Krusty’s face 
falls and he hurries off stage. 
INT. BACKSTAGE - CONTINUOUS 
As he walks through the wings, a STAGEHAND drapes a towel 
over his shoulders and an attractive woman in her late 


thirties, MISS PENNYCANDY, catches up and walks with him. 
She beams at him.

PENNYCANDY 
(ARDENTLY) Great show, Krusty! I 
really laughed when you... 
KRUSTY 
Yeah, yeah, where’s my nicotine gum? 
She hands him a square of gum which he begins to CHEW. 
KRUSTY (CONT’D) 
Ahh... that’s the stuff. Damn, I’m 
exhausted. Those kids were like ice 
out there. 
They continue walking. 
PENNYCANDY

Well, we... uh... made a terrible, 
terrible mistake. Uh... won’t happen

KRUSTY 


Well, the important thing is that I

But there was one boy who trusted me

INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY 
MAGGIE is by the dog’s water bowl nudging SANTA’S LITTLE 
HELPER out of the way and LAPPING up the water. At the 
stove, MARGE pushes down the cover of a pot, forcing down 
the legs of a mysterious animal. The phone RINGS. When 
Marge reaches for the phone, the legs of the animal spring 
back up, lifting the pot cover. 
MARGE 

Hello?

On the wall is a framed picture of Krusty standing with

(SIGHS) It’s Miss Pennycandy, I can 
assure you. (GETTING DOWN TO BUSINESS) 
I’m sorry to inform you that Krusty 
will once again not be joining Bart for 
dinner. 
MARGE * 
Oh, dear. This is the fifth time he’s 
cancelled. How can he hurt someone who 
loves him so? 
PENNYCANDY * 
(GAZING AT PICTURE) Oh, Mrs. Simpson, 
I’ve wasted my womanhood asking that 
same question. (THEN) I apologize for 
him, something really important came up 
at the last minute. 
INT. KRUSTY’S APT. - DAY 
Krusty is wearing rubber gloves scrubbing the shower with a 
scrub brush. A caddy filled with equipment -- sponge, 
Comet cleanser, etc.-- is next to him.

BART 
(SINGING) This could be the start of

MARGE 
Bart, I’m sorry, but Krusty isn’t 
coming to dinner tonight. 
Bart’s face falls. 
INT. SIMPSON HOUSE = BART’S ROOM = EVENING 
Bart CLEARS his desk with a sweep of his arm and then pulls 
out a pen and a piece of stationery that says: "From the 
Brain of Bart", with an illustration of a human brain in 
the top two corners. Bart begins WRITING. 
BART

Krusty is holding a phone receiver in his hand and looking 
at a card featuring a picture of a large breasted WOMAN and

Pennycandy BURSTS into the room, letter in hand. Krusty

Krusty takes the letter and looks at it very closely. 


8FOS5 FINAL DELIVERY 4/26/91 


KRUSTY 
(STRUGGLING) Uh...ehhh... deeee...

PENNYCANDY 
It says that the little boy who never 
lost faith in you has lost faith in 
you. Krusty, you are going to Bart 
Simpson’s house for dinner tonight. 
KRUSTY 
But I have plans. 
Pennycandy SLAPS hin. 
KRUSTY (CONT’D) 
Hey, not the face. 
PENNYCANDY 


Why you, maddening, impossible man. If 


you don’t go tonight, I won’t be here 
tomorrow. 

KRUSTY 
Oh, alright. I/’11 go. 


Pennycandy HUGS Krusty. 
KRUSTY (CONT’D) 


But you better let the Children’s 
Hospital know I won’t be at their 
fundraiser. 

Krusty exits. 

INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - DAY

door.

8FO5 FINAL DELIVERY 4/26/91 


MARGE 
Bart, wipe your feet. 

BART * 
(BITTERLY) Why bother, they’1l just get 
dirty again. You can wipe and wipe and 
wipe and wipe but you’ll never get the 
grime off this dirty world. 

MARGE 
Bart, I’ve got some good news. Krusty 
the Clown is coming to dinner tonight. 

BART 
He is, for sure? 

MARGE 


Yes. 


BART’S EYES 


EXTREME CLOSE UP 


BART 
(ECSTATIC) Oh, oh, yes, I knew he’d 


come. 


INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 


The Simpsons sit on their couch impatiently awaiting the 
arrival of their special guest. From behind the door we 
hear a Krusty LAUGH, a bicycle horn HONK, and "shave-and-a- 
hair-cut-two-bits" is KNOCKED out on the door. 


HOMER 


You think it’s him? 


Bart OPENS the door and Krusty enters with a somersault. 


KRUSTY 


Hi, kids! Hey, hey! 


11. 


8FOS FINAL DELIVERY 4/26/91 


His face winds up next to Maggie’s. Maggie begins to CRY 
and runs behind Marge’s leg for protection. 


KRUSTY (CONT’D) 
(UNCOMFORTABLE) Heh, heh, cute kid. 
(THEN) Good to see you, Bart. 
Bart shakes Krusty’s hand and the hand comes off. Homer 
LAUGHS UPROARIOUSLY along with Bart, Lisa and Marge. There 
is another KNOCK at the door. Bart opens the door 
revealing Milhouse dressed in a suit and tie. * 
MILHOUSE 
(ARTIFICIAL) Oh, hi Bart. I was just 
in the neighborhood. Why Krusty the 
Clown! What a surprise. 
BART 
Milhouse. You can come in and drop the 
(SHA-ROD) charade. 
Milhouse waves at his MOTHER who is still waiting in her 
car. She drives off. Bart leads Milhouse in the house. 
They see Krusty is riding a unicycle and balancing a 
feather duster on his nose. Homer is still LAUGHING. 
BART (CONT'D) 
Krusty, you don‘t have to be "on" 
tonight. 
HOMER 
What are you talking about? Of course 
he does. 
LISA * 
No, Dad, Krusty is our guest. (TO 
KRUSTY) Your pratfalls and Punchinello 


antics aren’t necessary here.? 


12. 


8FO5 FINAL DELIVERY 4/26/91 


BART 
Yeah, just relax and be yourself. 
Krusty gets off the unicycle and lowers his head. The 
feather duster continues to stick straight out defying 
gravity. 
KRUSTY 
Ohh, that’s a relief. 
He pulls the feather duster off his nose with a SUCTION 
SOUND and sticks it in his bag. He pulls a monkey out of 
the bag. 
KRUSTY (CONT’D) 
(TO MONKEY) Go wait in the car. 
The monkey roller skates out of the house. 
HOMER 
(MOANS) We could have seen a monkey. 
INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - DINING ROOM - LATER 
The family is waiting for dinner. 
MILHOUSE 
Hey Krusty, tell us about Sideshow Mel! 
KRUSTY 
Oh well, Mel and I don’t socialize much 
these days. We used to have a few 
drinks between shows, but then he got 
married, beneath himself, if you ask 
me, and well, it’s been awkward. 
Marge enters carrying the main course. 
MARGE 


Who wants to say grace?

6FO5 FINAL DELIVERY 4/26/91 14. 


LISA 
Why don’t we let our guest do it? 
Milhouse CLASPS his hands in prayer. 
MILHOUSE 
Bless us O lord... 
Bart WHACKS Milhouse in the head. 
MILHOUSE 
Hey! 
BART 
Krusty, would you do the honors? 
KRUSTY 
Well, alright. I’ma little rusty, but 
I’ll try. Baruch ata, addonoy, elohanu 
melech ha-olom, ha-motzee le-chem mean 
ha-aretz. 
Homer bursts out LAUGHING. 
HOMER 
He’s talking funny talk. 
LISA 
No, Dad, that’s Hebrew. Krusty must be 
Jewish. 
HOMER 


A Jewish entertainer? Get outta here. 


8FO5 FINAL DELIVERY 4/26/91 15. 


LISA * 
Dad, There are many prominent Jewish 
entertainers including Lauren Bacall, 
Dinah Shore, William Shatner, and Mel 
Brooks. 
HOMER 
Mel Brooks is Jewish? 
Krusty starts to SOB. 
BART 
Krusty, are you alright? 
KRUSTY 
Yes, it’s just that saying the brucha 
brings back a lot of painful memories. 
(GETTING EMOTIONAL) The old days... 
my... my father... 
Everyone at the table becomes uncomfortable as Krusty 
breaks down and begins to CRY. Krusty wipes his eyes with 
a long chain of multi-colored handkerchiefs he pulls out of 
his sleeve. At the end of the chain is a big pair of boxer 
shorts. Krusty blows his nose with a loud HONK. Homer 
tries to suppress a LAUGH, but bursts out LAUGHING anyway. 


FADE OUT.

wrong? You’ll feel better. 


Everyone, AD-LIBS encouragement for Krusty to tell his 
story. 


BART 
Yeah, spill your guts, man. 
LISA 


Come on... 


HOMER 
Yeah, Krusty, tell us. 

KRUSTY * 
Well, okay. First of all, my real name 
isn’t Krusty the Klown, it’s Hershel 
Krustofsky. My father was a rabbi. 
His father was a rabbi. His father’s 
father -- well, you get the idea.

FLASHBACK 
EXT. LOWER EAST SIDE OF SPRINGFIELD - DAY 
RABBI KRUSTOFSKY walks down the street with a SEVEN-YEAR- 
OLD KRUSTY. They are both wearing the traditional black 
clothes of Orthodox Jews. The street looks very much like 
the lower east side of New York City, circa 1920. 
KRUSTY (V.0.) 
My father was the most respected man in 
the lower east side of Springfield. 
People would come from miles around to 
ask his advice. 
A MAN approaches the Rabbi. 
MAN #1 
Reb Krustofsky, should I finish 
college? 
RABBI KRUSTOFSKY 
Yes. No one is poor except he who 
lacks knowledge. 
A WOMAN steps up to the Rabbi. 
WOMAN 
Rabbi, should I have another child? 
RABBI KRUSTOFSKY 
Yes, another child would be a blessing 
on your house. 
Another MAN approaches. 
MAN #2 


Rabbi, should I buy a Chrysler? 


8FO5 FINAL DELIVERY 4/26/91 18. 


RABBI KRUSTOFSKY 
Could you rephrase that as an ethical 
question? 

MAN #2 * 
(STRUGGLING) Hmm... is it right to buy 
a Chrysler? 

RABBI KRUSTOFSKY 
(MAKING A PRONOUNCEMENT) Yes, for 
great is the car with power steering 
and dyna-flow suspension. 

The man exits. Krusty turns to his father. 

YOUNG KRUSTY 
Papa, when I grow up, can I be a clown? 

RABBI KRUSTOFSKY 
No! A clown is not a respected member 
of the community. 

YOUNG KRUSTY 
But I want to make people laugh. 

RABBI KRUSTOFSKY 
Hershel, life is not fun. Life is 
serious. Seltzer is for drinking, not 
for spraying. Pie is for noshing, not 
for throwing. 

KRUSTY * 


But papa, can’t a person... 


8FO5 FINAL DELIVERY 4/26/91 


RABBI KRUSTOFSKY 
(INTERRUPTING) But nothing! You’1ll do 
as I say or you’1ll get such a zetz that 
you won’t even know what hit you. 
Young Krusty sadly looks over at a store: "Yiddle’s 
Practical Jokes, Magic Tricks, and Medical Supplies." 
Through the window we can see whoopee cushions, fake nose 
and glasses, dribble glasses, magic wands, and crutches. 
From a REVERSE ANGLE through the window, we see Krusty ina 
reverie until the Rabbi yanks him out of the frame. 
DISSOLVE To: 
INT. YESHIVA CLASSROOM - DAY 
KRUSTY (V.0.) 
Dad wanted me to follow in his 
footsteps, but the pull of clowning was 
too strong. I got my first big laughs 
at Yeshiva impersonating my father. 
A thirteen-year-old Krusty is standing up in front of the 
class. He holds a mop to his face which he strokes like a 
beard. 
YOUNG KRUSTY 
Blah, blah, blah, Moses! Blah, blah, 
blah, some prayer! 
The students LAUGH. Rabbi Krustofsky enters from the back 
of the room. He begins STRANGLING Young Krusty, a la Bart 
and Homer.

Homer starts to STRANGLE Bart, a la Krusty and his father. 
LISA 
Krusty, please continue.

INT. KRUSTOFSKY HOME - EVENING 
Rabbi Krustofsky is POUNDING on the bathroom door. 
KRUSTY (V.0.) 
My father tried to extinguish the 
comedy bug. But it was no use. 
RABBI KRUSTOFSKY * 
What are you doing in that bathroom? 
KRUSTY (0.S.) 
Go away. 
RABBI KRUSTOFSKY 
Open the door this instant. 
He BREAKS open the door revealing Krusty covered with pie 
filling and holding a seltzer bottle aimed at his own face. 
There are several pie tins around Krusty’s feet. Rabbi 
Krustofsky is horrified. 
RABBI KRUSTOFSKY (CONT‘D) 
Oy gevalt!

MONTAGE 
A. Inside "Yiddle’s Practical Jokes, Magic Tricks, and 
Medical Supplies" we see Young Krusty now wearing a baggy 
clown outfit. As he stands, smiling, in front of the 
mirror, MR. YIDDLE straightens his shoulders. 
YIDDLE 

Like a glove it fits. 
Krusty wears the clown suit throughout the montage. 
B. We see Krusty performing at a Shriner’s convention. 
Krusty holds up two Shriner fezes to his chest as if they 
are breasts to the SCREAMING LAUGHTER of drunken 
conventioneers. 
INT. GROSSINGERS - ON STAGE - NIGHT 


Krusty is in the process of TWISTING out an elaborate 
balloon sculpture. 


KRUSTY (V.0.) 
It was my big break. A Talmudic 
conference in the Catskills and I was 
the entertainment. 


Krusty has finished his sculpture. It’s a Star of David. 
The CROWD, consisting entirely of rabbis, APPLAUDS. 


KRUSTY (V.O. CONT’D) 
But the Lord works in mysterious ways. 


Krusty twists the balloon again, this time into a menorah. 
He then GASPS. 


KRUSTY’S POV 
We see his father talking to other rabbis. 
RABBI KRUSTOFSKY * 
Do you know that my son Hershel was 
first in his Yeshiva class. As a 
matter of fact, he was voted "The Most 


Likely to Hear God." 


8FO5 FINAL DELIVERY 4/26/91 22. 


RABBI #1 
Oh go on, Hymie. You’re exaggerating 
again. You’re so proud of your son. 
RABBI KRUSTOFSKY 
A rabbi never exaggerates. A rabbi 
composes; he creates thoughts; he tells 
stories that may never have happened, 
but he does not exaggerate. 
KRUSTY (V.0O. CONT’D) 
My father would have never have 
suspected a thing, were it not for one 
rowdy rabbi. 
ROWDY RABBI 
Hey, Funny-man! 
The ROWDY RABBI picks up a seltzer bottle and SQUIRTS 
Krusty. The other rabbis LAUGH as Krusty’s makeup is 
washed away. Rabbi Krustofsky goes from HYSTERICAL 
LAUGHTER to stunned silence. 
RABBI KRUSTOFSKY 
Hershel? Hershel! Oy vay iz mir! 
A HUSH falls on the crowd as Rabbi Krustofsky stands up. 
RABBI KRUSTOFSKY (CONT’D) 
You have brought shame on our family. 
Oh, if you were a musician or a jazz 
singer, this I could forgive. But 
this? I never want to see you again. 
You... you... clown!

KRUSTY 
(PULLING HIMSELF TOGETHER) And I 
haven’t seen my father since. 
LISA 
That is so sad.

Krusty, do you think about your father 
a lot? 
KRUSTY 
All the time. Except when I’m at the

CLOSE ON the coffee table. We see empty dessert dishes, 
coffee cups, etc. PULL BACK to reveal everyone looking 
extremely tired. Lisa is asleep and SNORING. Krusty 
however is quite TALKATIVE and chipper. He is going 
through the Simpson family photo album. We SEE the 
following pictures, with captions: 
A) "Bart’s First Haircut" Homer is holding down a crying 
little Bart to keep him in the chair. Taped next to the 
photo is a lock of Bart’s hair in the shape of a triangle. 
B) "Bart Learns To Swim" Homer is throwing Bart into the 
water. A horrified Bart is in mid-air spread eagled over 
the water. 
Cc) "Duff Gardens" Homer and Bart are on a roller coaster. 
Homer holds a horrified Bart above his head as they go over 
a drop. 
D) "4th of July" At a picnic, Bart is holding a large 


firecracker. Homer has finished lighting it and a 
terrified Bart watches the sparks fly.

Bart is on the phone. Lisa stands next to him. 
BART 
My question is, "If a son defies his 
father, and chooses a career that makes 
millions of children happy, shouldn’t 
the father forgive the son?"

her including: "Jewishness Revisited" "Views on Jews" "The 
Big Book of The Chosen people", etc. Bart is playing with 
a Jewish pop-up book. Adam and Eve in the garden of Eden 
pop up. Bart turns the page and we see Noah’s Ark pop up. 
The ark is surrounded by anguished people. Bart pulls a 
tab and the people are engulfed in water. Bart does FLOOD

Ahhh, Noah, Noah, save us, save us... 
No!! 
LISA 
This looks good Bart. Take it to hin. 
She hands Bart the paper. 
INT. TEMPLE HALLWAY ~ LATER 


Bart KNOCKS on the Rabbi’s door. The Rabbi opens the door

RABBI KRUSTOFSKY * 
You I told to go away. 
The Rabbi starts to close the door, but Bart sticks his 
foot in the door and begins to SPEAK, reading off of Lisa’s 
note. 
BART 
But... but... but, Rabbi, does it not 
say in the Babylonian Talmud... And I 
quote, "A child should be pushed aside 
with the left hand, and drawn closer 
with the right." 


Upon hearing these words, the Rabbi slowly opens the door. 
His interest is piqued. 


RABBI KRUSTOFSKY 


Yes. 


8FO5 FINAL DELIVERY 4/26/91 41. 


BART 
Then doesn’t your religion command you 
to make up with Krusty? 
There is a moment of silent reflection. 
RABBI KRUSTOFSKY 
But in Exodus, the fifth commandment 
says, "Honor thy Father and thy 
Mother." End of story. 
INT. SPRINGFIELD LIBRARY - DAY 
Lisa is surrounded by books.

Oh, it’s hopeless.

Bart and the Rabbi are wrapped in towels, enjoying a nice

BART 
"At all times let a man be supple as a

All the old men GRUMBLE in agreement. 
RABBI KRUSTOFSKY * 
But, my short learned friend, the Book 
of Joshua says, "You shall meditate on 
the Torah all day and all night." 


The old men GRUMBLE LOUDER in agreement. *

RABBI KRUSTOFSKY * 
Sorry my friend, I’m still not 
convinced. And this is hardly the time 
or place to discuss it. 
The BABY CRIES. 
EXT. SPRINGFIELD LIBRARY - DAY 


Unaccustomed to the light, Lisa shields her eyes from the

Here you go, Bart. It’s a long shot, 
but, that’s all I can do without

Bart and the rabbi are hunched over a chessboard. Lisa

BART 
(HOARSE) Rabbi, did not a great man 
say, "The Jews are a swinging bunch of 
people. I mean I’ve heard of 
persecution, but what they went through 
is ridiculous! But the great thing is 
after thousands of years of waiting and 
holding on and fighting, they finally 
made it." 
RABBI KRUSTOFSKY * 
Ohh, I never heard the plight of my 
people phrased so eloquently. Who said 
that, Rabbi Hillel? 
BART 
Nope. 
RABBI KRUSTOFSKY * 


It was Judah the Pious? 


BART 
Nope. 

RABBI KRUSTOFSKY

Oh, I got it -- the Dead Sea Scrolls.

I’m afraid not, Rabbi. It’s from "Yes, 
I Can" by Sammy Davis Jr. An 
entertainer. 
RABBI KRUSTOFSKY 
(GASPS) The candy man? 
The Rabbi sits down, STUNNED. 
RABBI KRUSTOFSKY (CONT’D) 
If a performer can think that way, 
maybe I’m completely upsidedown on this 
whole problem. You know something, 
you’re a very studious little boy. Do 
you do well in school? 
BART 
All A’s sir. 
LISA 
(SCOWLING) Yeah, right. 
RABBI KRUSTOFSKY * 
(BECOMING EMOTIONAL) All the years of

You’re on. 
Krusty walks on stage. 
KRUSTY * 
(TO THE CROWD) Boys and girls, I’d

The lights dim and a spotlight appears. Krusty walks into 
the light and it moves away from him. He walks up to it 
again, and it moves again. 
KRUSTY (CONT’D) “Re

Krusty steps into the spotlight. *

We haven’t seen each other in twenty- 
five years. 
RABBI KRUSTOFSKY 
(TO KRUSTY) Oh, I love you, son. 
KRUSTY 
I love you too, Daddy. 


The Rabbi shoves a pie in Krusty’s face. They share a 
LAUGH. Bart and Lisa smile. 


FADE OUT. 
THE END

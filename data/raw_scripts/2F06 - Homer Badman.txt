ACT ONE 
SCENE 1 


INT. SIMPSONS’ KITCHEN 


The SIMPSONS eat breakfast. Bart pours cereal into a bowl. 


He begins 


separating the brightly-colored stars and clovers 


from the whole grain pieces. 


He scoops 


a 


BART 
(DISGUSTED) Damn FDA. Why can’t it all 
be marshmallow? 
up the tan pieces and dumps them back in the box. 

LISA 
Eeew. Bart, don’t put the non- 
marshmallow pieces back in the box. 
They go in the trash. 

HOMER 
You like sweets, kids? (HAS A SECRET) 
I know a place that’s sweeter than 
sweetness itself. In this sweet place, 
earthly donuts are sour as poison. 
You’d spit them out! You would! I’m 
talking about the Candy Industry Trade 
Show. (WAVING TWO BRIGHTLY COLORED 
TICKETS) . 

LISA 


How did you get tickets?

HOMER 
They hid them in every millionth Krusty 
Klump bar and Krusty Klump bar with 
almonds. 
FLASHBACK 
INT. KWIK-E-MART 


Homer is systematically squeezing, pawing, crushing, and 
ripping through every Krusty Klump bar in the store. 


APU 
Hey, hey, hey! I’ve asked you nicely 
not to mangle my merchandise. You 
leave me no choice but to ask you 
nicely again. 
HOMER 
Can’t talk - greedy. 
Homer continues ripping through the Krusty Klump bars. 
BACK TO SCENE 
BART 
CanIcome! ?CanIcome! ?CanIcome!? 
LISA 
No,me!Takeme!Me!Me!Me! 
HOMER 
Sorry kids, but this is one event when 
I want my darling wife by my side. 
MARGE 
(PLEASED) Oh, well thank you Homer. But 


take one of the kids.

HOMER 
(WHINY) Ma-arge. They can’t carry 
enough samples. (PINCHING LISA’S ARM) 
They have puny, little muscles, not 
big, ropey ones like you. 

MARGE 
(ANNOYED MURMUR) 

BART 
Yes. You go, Mom. For the greater 
good. 

LISA 
(SOLEMNLY) For the greater good. 

INT. SIMPSONS’ LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON 


Bart and Lisa sew extra pockets on Marge’s clothes. She is 
wearing an overcoat with saddlebags on the inside. 


MARGE 
Homer, are all these pockets necessary? 
HOMER 
They wouldn’t be if you were willing to 
sit in a hollowed-out wheelchair. 
The doorbell RINGS. 
MARGE 
That’s the babysitter. (TO BART AND 
LISA) No one in town will sit for you 
two anymore. TI had to choose between a 
grad student at the university and a 


scary-looking hobo. 


BART 


2F06 FINAL 5/27/94 Page 


(GOING TO ANSWER THE DOOR) Please the 


hobo. 


Please the hobo. 


Please the hobo. 


He opens the door revealing a pretty, YOUNG WOMAN in a 


coat. 
ASHLEY 


Hi, I’m Ashley Grant. 
LISA 


Ashley Grant! 


You gave a talk on 


women’s issues at my school on how we 


don’t have to be second class citizens. 


BART 
(PANICKED) Mom! 
with this maniac?! 

HOMER 


Hurry, Marge. 


How can you leave us 


If we get there early we 


can get our pictures taken with the two 


surviving Musketeers. 
Homer drags Marge out the door. 
MARGE 
(BEING PULLED OUT THE 
also a baby somewhere 
Bart saunters up to Ashley. 


BART 


DOOR) There’s 


upstairs! 


So, you’re one of those "don’t call me 


a chick" chicks, huh? 


2F06 FINAL 5/27/94 Page 


LISA 
Sorry about my sexist brother. He will 
make the next few hours a living hell. 
ASHLEY 
Oh, I don’t know. See this, Bart? 


She pulls a video game cartridge out of her bag and waves 
it around. 


BART 
(EYES FOLLOWING IT AS IF ENTRANCED) 
Disemboweler 4, the game where 
condemned criminals dig at each other 
with rusty hooks. 

ASHLEY 
Mmm hmm. Do a little housework, and you 
can play for five minutes. 

BART 
No waaaay. (STRUGGLING LIKE CAPTAIN 
KIRK FIGHTING A MIND RAY) Gg-aah... 
Yes’m. 

ASHLEY 
See, Lisa? Males aren’t hard to tame. 
They all follow their video cartridges. 


Ashley waves the video to the right and Bart runs into the 
wall. Lisa looks at Ashley with admiration. 


EXT. SPRINGFIELD CONVENTION CENTER - LATE AFTERNOON. SC 2 
A sign reads "Welcome Candy Convention, Room 1! Also 
Candy-shaped Rat Poison Convention, Room 11." Police 
barricades hold back crowds of fat kids, as candy buyers 
show ID to a doorman and enter. 


2F06 FINAL 5/27/94 


INT. CANDY CONVENTION 


A high angle sees hundreds of booths of candy products laid 
out on the floor in rows. 


PA (V.O.) 
Mr. Goodbar to the front desk... The 
front desk is looking for Mr. Goodbar. 
HOMER 
(GASP) I feel like a kid in some kind 
of a store. 
Homer surveys the wondrous array. He begins walking by 
each booth daintily sampling candy with one hand while 
surreptitiously sweeping armfuls of samples into Marge’s 
many pockets. 
HOMER (CONT’D) 
(MOUTH FULL, TO SALESPEOPLE) 
Brilliant... exquisite ...you’1ll do 
well... Gimme those, etc. 
ANGLE ON CHOCOLATE BOOTH AND PEANUT BUTTER BOOTH 
A booth advertising "CHOCOLATE" is right next to the booth 
showing "PEANUT BUTTER." A YOUNG MAN in a suit runs across 
with a big piece of chocolate and collides with a YOUNG 
WOMAN carrying a beaker of peanut butter. 
PEANUT BUTTER WOMAN 
You got chocolate in my peanut butter! 
CHOCOLATE MAN 


You got peanut butter in my chocolate! 


The woman breaks off a little chocolate with peanut butter 
and tastes it. 


PEANUT BUTTER WOMAN 
My product is ruined. We’ll be 


bringing legal action. 


Page 6. 


2F06 FINAL 5/27/94 Page 


CHOCOLATE MAN 
Fine. We’ll drag it out for years. 
Homer grabs their chocolate and peanut butter. 
HOMER 
Case closed. 


Homer hands them to Marge, who puts them in her already 
bulging pockets. Homer and Marge walk quickly away. 


SOUR BALL BOOTH 


Behind FRINK’S booth is a HUMMING force field. A yellow 
candy is hovering in the air. 


FRINK 
As you can see, I have created a 
lemonball so sour it can only be safely 
contained in a magnetic field. (TURNS 
TO EMPTY FORCE FIELD) The candy, known 
as 77X42, has several unusual -- 
(SURPRISED NOISE) Where the hell is the 
candy? 
HOMER 
I ‘unno. 
We see his entire face has puckered implosively. 
WAX LIP BOOTH 
The booth displays big, different-colored wax lips. A sign 
reads, "Wax Lips - The Candy of 1,000 Uses." The SALESMAN 
wears a pair. Homer walks up to hin. 
SALESMAN 
Hey sir, try our wax lips. It’s the 


candy of a thousand uses. 


2F06 FINAL 5/27/94 Page 


HOMER 
Like what? 
SALESMAN 
One, a humorous substitute for your own 
lips. 
HOMER 
Mmm hmm. Keep going. 
SALESMAN 
Two, ah... I’m needed in the basement. 
The salesman does a bad pantomime of WALKING DOWN STAIRS 
until he disappears. After a beat, he sneaks a peek, 
peering over the counter, then disappears again. Homer 
sweeps an armful of wax lips into his pants. 
ANOTHER ANGLE 
Marge staggers to a bench, pockets bulging. She sits down 
to rest and takes a stalk of celery out of her purse. A 
SECURITY GUARD grabs the celery away. 
SECURITY GUARD 
You’re gonna have to put some sugar on 
that celery or get out, mam. 
GERMAN GUMMI CANDY BOOTH 
It is by far the largest most impressive display. The sign 
reads "Jolli Gummi Bears -- They Hibernate In Your Colon." 
There is a fat GERMAN SALESMAN. Homer is taking samples 
and stuffing them in his mouth. 
HOMER 
Oooh -- gummy bears. Gummy Rolodex. 
Gummy calves heads. Gummy lint. 
Homer’s eyes are caught by a glistening reflection. He 
looks over and sees a sparkling, green, gummy object on a 


velvet cushion, rotating in a mirrored case under exquisite 
lighting. Homer freezes. His mouth drops open. 


2F06 FINAL 5/27/94 


HOMER (CONT’D) 
(MOUTH FULL) What dat? 

GUMMY SALESMAN 
(GERMAN ACCENT) That is the rarest 
gummy of them all. The gummy Venus de 
Milo. Carved by gummy artisans who 
work exclusively in the medium of 
gummy. 

MARGE 
Will you two stop saying "gummy" so 
much. 


The gummy statue sparkles on the velvet cushion and winks 
at him like a siren. 


HOMER 
Must have rare gummy. (WHISPERING TO 
MARGE) Distract the salesman Marge! 
MARGE 
No. I won’t make a spectacle out of 
myself any further. 
Marge puts her hands on her hips and glares at Homer. A 
pocket springs loose and gumballs flow forth like a 
fountain. People look at Marge. 
MARGE (CONT’D) 
(TO CROWD) Oooh... how’d they get 
there? (WEAK LAUGH) 
In the confusion, Homer moves over to the display case 


unseen. He begins limbering his fingers like a safe- 
cracker. 


Page 9. 


2F06 FINAL 5/27/94 


HOMER 
Now, this is going to take all my 
skill. (CHUCKLE) 


He SMASHES the glass with his fist and grabs the gummy, 
setting off a PIERCING ALARM. 


GUMMY SALESMAN 
Halt! Halt! Offen gan shtein mannen! 
HOMER 
Run, Marge! Save the booty! 
Marge waddles as fast as she can towards the door. The 
crowd is gaining on them. Homer stops, grabs a can of 
cola, pulls out a bag marked "Pop Rocks," rips off the top 
with his teeth, and pours the pop rocks into the cola. 
CROWD 
(AD-LIBBING) After him/ Get the candy, 
etc... 
HOMER (CONT’D) 
See you in hell, candy boys. 


Homer tosses the cola can into the crowd a la a grenade, 
then runs off. There is a gigantic off stage EXPLOSION. 


INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM SCENE 3 
Marge stands in the middle of the room in her candy-filled 
overcoat; odd movements and RUSTLING going on underneath 
the fabric. She GIGGLES. Suddenly, Bart pops his head out 
between two buttons next to her stomach. 
BART 
Hey Lis, I found a big caramel deposit 
at the small of her back! 
LISA 
I’m coming! 


Bart takes a deep BREATH and dives back inside. Lisa 
follows.

MARGE 
(GIGGLES) 
Maggie sticks her head out of one of Marge’s pockets 
wearing wax lips which she SUCKS like her pacifier. A 
moment later Marge’s entire outfit RIPS open sending candy 
and children TUMBLING to the floor. 
BART/LISA/MAGGIE 
Wheee! 


Homer falls down on his hands and knees and starts pawing 
through the candy. 


HOMER 
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Where’s 
my gummy de Milo? She can’t have 
gotten far; she has no arms. 
MARGE 
I’m sure she’ll turn up. Take the baby- 
sitter home now. She’s been sitting in 
the car for twenty minutes. 
HOMER 
Relax, Marge, there’s plenty for her to 
do in there. 
SFX: THREE HORN HONKS 
HOMER (CONT’D) 
See, she’s having the time of her life. 
INT. SIMPSONS’ CAR - NIGHT 
Homer drives the baby-sitter back. 
HOMER 
(MUMBLING) Venus, venus, oh where’s my 


venus? 


Page 11. 


2F06 FINAL 5/27/94 Page 12. 


ASHLEY 
Excuse me? 
HOMER 
I’m craving something I can’t find. 
ASHLEY 
(CONFUSED) Ah, I don’t understand. 
HOMER 
My wife doesn’t understand either. But 
aman like me has certain passions... 
ASHLEY 
(CREEPED OUT) Just drop me off here. 
He pulls over. As she gets out of her seat, he notices the 
gummy Venus de Milo stuck to the back of her jeans. 
Heavenly music PLAYS. The candy seems to glow magically 
and wink at him. 
HOMER (CONT’D) 
(GASPS, THEN UNDER HIS BREATH) 
Precious Venus... Oh, this is going to 
be good. 
He starts to peel it off. Ashley GASPS and turns around. 
ASHLEY’S POV 


The babysitter sees Homer grabbing at her butt, his head 
back in a slobbering position. 


HOMER (CONT’D) 
(GURGLES HUNGRILY) 

ASHLEY 
(SCREAMS) 


She SLAMS the car door and runs off.

INT. CAR 
HOMER 
(CALLING OUT WINDOW) Thank you! 
He eats the candy happily. 


INT. SIMPSON’S LIVING ROOM - THE NEXT MORNING 


Bart and Lisa come downstairs. Homer points to a still 


sizeable pile of candy on the floor. 
HOMER 
Hey, kids. Lots of candy left for 
breakfast. 
BART/LISA 
(PAINFULLY FULL GROAN) 
MARGE 
Well why don’t we give it to some needy 
children, then? 
BART/LISA 


(GREEDY "NO WAY" MOAN) 


They start to grudgingly stuff down candy, GROANING as they 


chew. 
VARIOUS YELLERS (0.S.) 
Homer is a pig! Down with Homer! 
HOMER 
Oh no! The candy conventioneers 


tracked us down! 


They look out the window and see the yard is full of 
PROTESTORS. Signs include: "Homer Bad Man" and "You Made A 


Big Ms. Take."

There’s the man that sexually harassed

EXT. SIMPSON HOUSE 


A half-a-dozen college-age women and men protesters are 
CHANTING. 


PROTESTORS 
(CHANTING) Two four six eight / Homer’s 
crime was very great! (PAUSE) "Great" 
meaning "large or immense" / We used it 
in the pejorative sense! 
INT. SIMPSON HOUSE 
Homer’s finishing explaining to Marge. 
HOMER 


Marge, I swear I didn’t touch her. You 


v know how bashful I am. I can’t even 
say the word "titmouse" without 
giggling like a schoolgirl. (SCHOOLGIRL 
TITTER) 

MARGE 
At any rate, I think you should go 
outside and straighten this out. And 
be nice, or it could turn ugly. 
HOMER 
i Okay... (BEAT) Titmouse! (SCHOOLGIRL 


TITTER)

Homer and Marge come outside. Ashley points to hin.

ASHLEY 
You grabbed me in the car! 

HOMER 
Oh that. No. I was just grabbing a 
gummy Venus de Milo that got stuck to 
your pants. 

HEAVY WOMAN 
(TO ASHLEY) He’s lying! They don’t 
make gummy Venus de Milos! (OFF THEIR 
LOOKS) Or so I hear. 

PROTESTORS 
Boo! 

HOMER 
c’mon, I’m a decent guy... 


The wind comes along and BLOWS up his bathrobe, exposing 
everything. The protestors GASP and BOO. 


INT. SIMPSONS HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 
Homer dashes inside as rocks HIT the front door. 
BART 
Why would anybody want to touch a 
girl’s butt? That’s where cooties come 
from. 
LISA 
Dad, I don’t understand. What is she 


saying you did?

HOMER 
Remember that post card Grampa sent us 
from Florida of that alligator biting 
that woman’s bottom? 
BART 
(LAUGHING) Oh, yeah. That was 
brilliant. 
HOMER 
That’s right, we all thought it was 
hilarious. But it turns out we were 
wrong. That alligator was sexually 
harrassing that woman. 
BART 
And the dog in the Coppertone ad? Same 
deal, Dad? 
HOMER 
Well, that’s kind of a gray area. 
BART 
We know you’re innocent, Dad. 
HOMER 
Thanks, kids. 
Marge is looking out the window. 
MARGE 
They seem to be building some sort of 


shantytown.

PROTESTORS 
(AD-LIBBING) Evil! Boo! Bad man! 
Sexist pig! 
HOMER 
Do your worst, protestors you can’t 
stop me from living my life! 
WE PUSH IN to Homer’s rocking head. 
MATCH CUT: 


Homer is stuck in a traffic jam and protestors are ROCKING 
his car. 


PROTESTORS 
Boo! No respect for women,no peace. 
MATCH CUT: 


PULL BACK to see the protestors rocking Homer’s chair back 
and forth at his work station. 


PROTESTORS 
Just try to push the right buttons now! 
We aren’t crazy about nuclear power, 
either! 
SMITHERS walks over to them. 
SMITHERS 
(STERNLY) Can I see your passes 
please? 
The protestors stop dead. 
HOMER 
(GLUM) It’s okay, they’re with me. 


Smithers exits. The protestors resume SHAKING Homer.

PROTESTORS 
Boo! You had your chance. 
INT. BARBER SHOP SCENE 5 
Homer is getting shaved. Protestors stand around hin, 
SHAKING his barber chair. The BARBER uses a straight razor 
and nicks him again and again. 
PROTESTORS 
No shaving for you! Try to get a good 
shave! Why would you try to get a 
shave today? 
HOMER 
Ow, OW, OW, OW, OW, OW, OW. 
INT. SIMPSONS BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Homer and Marge are in bed. 
HOMER 
Come on, Marge. Why aren’t you in the 
mood? 
PROTESTORS (0.S.) 
(CHANTING) He’s too fat, he needs a 
wig! / Homer is a sexist pig! 
HOMER 
Oh. (WALKS TO WINDOW, CALLING OUT) 
Could you guys chant something more 
romantic? 


We hear a discussion MUMBLE from the crowd then: 


Page 19. 


2F06 FINAL 5/27/94 Page 20. 


PROTESTORS 
(CHANTING) You want romance/ we will 
spoil it/ picture Grandma on the 
toilet. 

MARGE/HOMER 
(GROAN) 

MARGE 
(IMPRESSED) They‘re fast. 

HOMER 
(SAD SIGH) They’re ruining my whole 
life. Marge, please, this is where I 
need you the most. I’m counting on you 
to do something or say something to 
make it all better. Okay-- go. 

MARGE 
Homer -~- 

HOMER 
(TOO EAGER) Uh-huh? 

MARGE 
I already talked to the Indignation 
Coordinator out on the lawn today. I 
told her you were a decent man. But she 
wouldn’t listen. Besides standing by 
you and supporting you, there isn’t 


anything more I can do. 


2F06 FINAL 5/27/94 Page 


HOMER 
You mean, I’m on my own? I’ve never 
been on my own. (BUILDING PANTC) Oh 
no! On own! On own! I need help. Oh, 
God help me! Help me, God! 
The phone RINGS. Homer slowly picks it up. 
HOMER 
(NERVOUSLY EXPECTANT, EYES DARTING) 
Yello? 
DEEP VOICE 
Hello, Homer. This is God...frey Jones 
from the TV magazine show, Rock Bottom. 
We’re aware of your problems and Mr. 
Simpson, we want to help. 
curt To: 
Godfrey in the Rock Bottom office, reading from a form 
titled "Standard Pitch Form". We see "Mr. Simpson" is 
written above other crossed out names including, "Mr. 
Buttafuoco" and "Mr. Gillooly." 
HOMER 
Hmm, I saw that report you did on 
Sasquatch. It was fair and even- 
handed. I/’11 do it. 
INT. ROCK BOTTOM STUDIO 


Homer sits in a chair in front of the camera telling his 
story. 


2F06 FINAL 5/27/94 Page 


HOMER 
..+.-Somebody had to take the babysitter 
home. Then I noticed, in the car she 
was sitting on the gummy venus so I 
grabbed it off of her. Oh, just 
thinking about that sweet sweet candy. 
(DROOLS) I just wish I had another one 
right now. But the most important thing 
Liew 

GODFREY 
That was really great, Mr. Simpson, we 
got everything we need. 

HOMER 
Okay. Is that Sasquatch still around? 
I’d love to meet him. 

GODFREY 


BS (BEAT) Yeah, sure. 


A MAN being zipped into a bad Sasquatch suit approaches 
Homer. 


SASQUATCH 
Yeah, how ya doin’? Here’s my card. I 
do kids’ birthday parties. Scares the 
bejesus out of them. 

HOMER 
(IN AWE) Wow! Proof positive at last! 


CUT TO: 


2F06 FINAL 5/27/94 


INT. SIMPSONS - LIVING ROOM - LATER SCENE 6 
On the TV we see familiar typewriter ball graphics a la 
Hard Copy, only the ball is carved out of stone. It TYPES 
out "Rock Bottom." PULL BACK to see the Simpsons watching. 
HOMER 
(GLEEFULLY) Hee hee. Here comes the 
bouncing ball of justice! 
ON TV 
ROCK BOTTOM ANNOUNCER 
Tonight on "Rock Bottom:" we go 
undercover at a sex farm for sex 
hookers. 
We see an inbred FARMER standing in front of a barn. 
FARMER 
I keep tellin’ ya, I just grow sorghum 
here. 
VOICE (0.S.) 
Uh huh, and where are the hookers? 
FARMER 
‘Round back...oops. 
ROCK BOTTOM ANNOUNCER 
But first... she was a university honor 
student who devoted her life to kids, 
until the night a grossly overweight 
pervert named Homer Simpson gave her a 
crash course in depravity. (BEAT; 


OMINOUSLY) Babysitter and the Beast.

INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
HOMER 

Awww, crap! 
He clutches Marge’s arm. 
ON TV 
We see a shot of Ashley looking sweet at her graduation in 
a cap and gown. Then, in slow motion and with SCARY MUSIC 
we see Homer walking down the driveway to his car, his head 
getting bigger and bigger on cmaera until it fills the 
frame and freezes on the scariest frame they could find. 
ROCK BOTTOM 
CUT TO: Homer in the studio. His voice is lowered and 
satanic, and his speech is stitched together with badly- 
matched edits. 

HOMER 

+++ Somebody had to take the babysitter 

home. Then I noticed she was sitting 

on (BAD EDIT) -- her -- "sweet can"! - 

- so I grabbed -- her "sweet can"! 

(DROOLS) Oh, just thinking about -- her 


"can"! I just wish I had her -- 


"sweet, Sweet, sweet, sweet can"! 


As Homer sits through these obvious terrible edits the 
clock behind him jumps around in time and his tie changes 
angles. We see Godfrey’s fake reaction - he is obviously 
outside in a different location. 
GODFREY 

Mr. Simpson, you just admitted to some 

pretty serious charges. What do you 

have to say in your defense? 


CcuT TO: 


2F06 FINAL 5/27/94 


Another obvious freeze frame of Homer, his mouth slightly 
open, one eye slightly closed. Ominous MUSIC PLAYS. 


GODFREY (CONT’D) 
Mr. Simpson, your silence will only 
incriminate you further. 
We start a bad ZOOM in into the freeze photo in a desperate 
attempt to indicate that Homer is advancing on the 
reporter. 
GODFREY (CONT’D)

HOMER’S FANTASY 
EXT. UNDERWATER WONDERLAND 
The Simpsons and FISH CHARACTERS are frolicking and dancing 
happily a la "The Little Mermaid." Bart plays a clan 
xylophone, Lisa blows a saxophone sea horse, Marge bows the 
tentacles of a jellyfish, and Maggie rides a manta ray. As 
Homer sings, he takes bites out of, or completely devours, 
the happy, SINGING creatures. The creatures go from 
looking cute to extremely worried as they go into Homer’s 
mouth. He leaves shells and fish skeletons behind him. 
ALL 
(SINGING) Under the sea / Under the sea 
/ Life will be groovy / Like a popular 
movie / Under the sea. 
INSTRUMENTAL BREAK 
Homer eats lots of terrified sea creatures. 
HOMER 
(SINGING) Where a man can be free/ 
Indefinitely/ Under the sea here/ 
That’s where I’1l be here/ Under the 
sea. 
BACK TO SCENE 
MARGE 
Homer, that’s your solution to 
everything, to move under the sea. 
It’s not gonna happen. 
HOMER 
Not with that attitude.

over.

Suddenly we see several bright lights playing through the 
curtains and hear a distant ROAR that keeps getting LOUDER 
and LOUDER. Lisa opens the curtains to reveal a formation 
of helicopters bearing down on the house a la "Apocalypse 
Now." Four TV vans SCREECH to a halt in front of the 
house. An army of REPORTERS pile out.

HOMER

He tries to hide his nakedness behind the plastic shower 
curtain, slips and falls to the floor. A PHOTOGRAPHER 
takes a picture of him lying on the floor wrapped in the 
shower curtain.

That’s okay. Your tears say more than

daughters, reunited by their hatred of 
Homer Simpson. And here’s your host, 


Gentle Ben. 


GENTLE BEN lumbers out on all fours, wearing a helmet with 
a microphone on it. APPLAUSE. He makes a GREETING GROWL. 


VARIOUS AUDIENCE MEMBERS 
"Here, Ben!" “Over here!" "I have a

Ben bounds over to an AUDIENCE MEMBER and gets up on his

The audience APPLAUDS. 
WOMAN #2 
Ben, I have a question. 
Ben begins heading toward her, but then shoots right past 
her. We see he’s up on his hind legs greedily devouring 
everything on the craft services table. The TRAINER comes 
running over. 
TRAINER 
No, Ben! No! 
Ben matter-of-factly sweeps him away with his paw. A bear 
control squad SHOOTS him in the back with a bunch of 
tranquilizer darts. The bear rears up and falls backward 
onto a row of SCREAMING audience members. The scene is 
replaced by color bars, then a title card of a very 
concerned-looking Ben listening to a woman’s complaint.

There’s a commotion outside. Homer, Marge and the kids look

AD-LIBBING "Let us through" etc...

done some bad things in my life, but 
harassing women is not one of them.

ACT ONE 


FADE IN: 
INT. SIMPSONS! LIVING ROOM - EVENING 


The Simpsons are gathered around a wobbly card table, 
playing a board game. 


BART 
Come on, Mom. 
LISA 
Yeah, Mom, hurry up. 
MARGE 
All right... Hmmm... How about "he"? 
She places the tiles forming the word "he" on the board. A 
shot of the board shows that all the words are on this 
level -- "he", "hat", "egg", "go", "can". "The" is used 
twice. 
MARGE (CONT'D) 


Two points. Your turn, dear. 


Final Delivery - 5/31/89 - Page 2. 


HOMER 
(TO HIMSELF) Hmmmm. How could anyone 
make a word out of these lousy letters? 
We see that Homer's tiles are arranged O-X-I-D-I-2Z-E. 
HOMER (CONT'D) 
Oh, wait! Here's a good one -- "do". 


He places his tiles on the board. Lisa takes her turn 
immediately. 


LISA 
"Id." Triple word score. 
HOMER 
Hey! No abbreviations! 
LISA 
Not I.D., Dad. Id. It's a word. 
BART 
As in "This game is stup-id." 
HOMER 
Hey, shut up, boy. 
LISA 
Yeah, Bart. You're supposed to be 
developing verbal abilities for your 
big aptitude test tomorrow. 
MARGE 
We could look this "id" thing up in the 
dictionary. 
HOMER 


We got one? 


Final Delivery - 5/31/89 - Page 3. 


MARGE 
I think it's under the short leg of the 
couch. 
Homer takes the dictionary out from under the couch, 
stopping at the fruit bowl to get himself a banana on the 
way back. He starts to hand the dictionary to Marge, but 
Lisa grabs it away, opens it, and reads from it. 
LISA 
"Id. Along with the ego and the 
superego, one of three components of 
the psyche." 
HOMER 
(DUBIOUS) Get outta here. 
BART 
My turn. "Kwyjibo." K-W-Y-J-I-B-0. 
Twenty-two points. Plus triple word 
score. Plus fifty points for using all 
my letters. Game's over. I'm outta 


here. 


He places the tiles on the board. Then as he starts to 
leave, Homer grabs him. 


HOMER 
Wait a minute, you little cheater. 
You're not going anywhere until you 
tell me what a kwyjibo is. 

BART 


Kwyjibo: Uh, a big, dumb, balding...

BART'S P.O.V. - HOMER EATING THE BANANA 
BART (CONT'D) 
North American ape... with no chin... 
MARGE 
And a short temper. 
HOMER 
I'll show you a big dumb balding ape! 


Homer starts after Bart, knocking the card table over in 
the process. 


BART 
Uh oh, Kwyjibo on the loose! 
CUT TO: 

EXT. SCHOOL PLAYGROUND - MORNING - NEXT DAY 
It is shortly before the time to go inside for class. 
Children are seen getting off buses, playing kickball, 
shooting marbles, and jumping rope. In a corner of the 
playground is Bart, surrounded by a group of BOYS, 
including MILHOUSE, who is white, RICHARD, who is Asian, 
and LEWIS, who is black. Bart is spray-painting a picture 
of Principal Skinner on a school wall. Under the picture 
it says: "Principle Skinner". A word balloon from the 
drawing's mouth says: "I ama weiner". Everyone is 
laughing. Bart's hands are covered with red paint. 
ELSEWHERE ON THE PLAYGROUND 


PRINCIPAL SKINNER is strolling around, looking for 
troublemakers in his spare time. He points to a BOY. 


SKINNER 
You, there! No chewing gum on school 
grounds. In the trash can with it! 


MARTIN PRINCE, every teacher's pet, comes running up to 
Skinner. 


Final Delivery - 5/31/89 - Page 


MARTIN 
Principal Skinner! One of my fellow 
children is vandalizing school 
property. 

SKINNER 
on? Where? 


They dash off together. Back in the corner, Bart is 
signing his work with a set of red handprints. 


MILHOUSE 

Look out Bart, here comes Skinner! 
BART 

Yikes. 


He tosses the can away. Skinner arrives on the scene. 
Bart hides his hands behind his back. 


SKINNER 
Umm... Whoever did this is in very 
deep trouble. 
MARTIN 
And a sloppy speller, too. The 
preferred spelling of wiener is 
W-I-E-N-E-R, although E-I is an 
acceptable ethnic variant. 
SKINNER 
Good boy. Boys, let's see your hands. 
One by one the other boys do so, until only Bart is left. 
SKINNER 
(CHECKING HANDS) Mmm-hmm... good... 


okay... Simpson? 


Final Delivery - 5/31/89 - Page 6. 


Bart shows his red palms unhappily. 
MARTIN 
You might say you caught him red- 
handed! 
The school bell RINGS. 
SKINNER 
Simpson, you and I are going to have a 
little talk. 
BART 
Same time, same place? 
SKINNER 
Yes, in my office after school. 
KIDS 
Oooh! 
BART 
(GULPS ) 
INT. CLASSROOM - MORNING 
The students file into the classroom from the playground. 
Bart sits at his desk, which is next to the teacher's and 
near a window. Martin walks past Bart on the way to his 
seat. 
MARTIN 
Bart. I hope you won't bear some sort 
of simple-minded grudge against me. I 
was merely trying to fend off the 
desecration of the school building. 
BART 


Eat my shorts. 


Final Delivery - 5/31/89 - Page 7. 


MARTIN 
Pardon. 
Martin walks away and Mrs. Krabappel addresses the class as 
she hands test booklets to the students at the front of 
each row, who pass them back. 
MRS. KRABAPPEL 
Now I don't want you to worry, class. 
These tests will have no effect on your 
grades. They merely determine your 
future social status and financial 
success. (TO BART) If any. 
Martin raises his hand. 
MARTIN 
Mrs. Krabappel, isn't Bart supposed to 
face the window so he won't be tempted 
to look at his neighbor's paper? 
MRS. KRABAPPEL 
You're right, Martin. Bart? 
Bart turns his desk with an annoyed GRUNT. 
MRS. KRABAPPEL (CONT'D) 
Remember to visualize the complex 
problems. And relax. The test will 
start ... NOoW!! 
The test books SNAP open and the room falls silent. As we 
see the students working, the only sounds are the 
occasional CREAKING of chairs, SCRIBBLING PENCILS, and 
FLIPPING of pages. Bart looks very frustrated, pushing his 
open palms vicelike against the sides of his head. He 


takes a look and sees that Martin is whizzing through the 
material, a carefree grin on his face. Bart sags. 


Final Delivery - 5/31/89 - Page 8. 


BART 
(QUIETLY, TO HIMSELF) At seven-thirty 
a.m. an express train traveling sixty 
miles an hour leaves Santa Fe bound for 
Phoenix, five hundred and twenty miles 
away. 
MRS. KRABAPPEL 
(WHISPERING, TAPS HER HEAD) Shhhhh! 
Visualize it, Bart! 
BART (V.O.) 
At the same time a local train 
traveling thirty miles an hour and 
carrying forty passengers leaves 
Phoenix bound for Santa Fe. 
The scene DISSOLVES to Bart's visualization of the problen. 
A train pulls out of a station marked "Phoenix" with a 
clock reading 7:30. There is only one track shown. 
BART (V.O. CONT'D) 
It's eight cars long and always carries 
the same number of passengers in each 
car. 
Inside the train, Bart sees himself standing near the 
doors. He looks down the length of the car. Superimposed 
is the equation 40 - 8 =, then over the heads of each of 
the passengers in the car appear the numbers 1 2 3 4 5. 
Bart is pleased so far. The train is shown rolling through 


the countryside as the narration continues. He is wearing 
a watch and looks at it; it reads 8:30. 


Final Delivery - 5/31/89 - Page 9. 


BART (V.O. CONT'D) 
An hour later, a number of passengers 
equal to half the number of minutes 
past the hour get off, but three times 
as many plus six get on. 


Bart is knocked about in the doorway by the exiting and 
entering passengers. A briefcase bops him in the stomach. 


BART (CONT'D) 
Oof! 


The passengers step over him. The train is shown pulling 
into another station. The clock reads 9:10. 


BART (V.O. CONT'D) 
At the second stop half the passengers 
plus two get off, but twice as many get 
on as got on at the first stop. 
The car is now a mass of humanity. People are moving 
around, getting into seats, getting out of seats to let 
others in. Numbers appear over their heads, but are 
confused as the people cross paths. Random numbers and 
signs start popping up: 8, 327, 211, 18 1/2, 32.54, etc. 
Suddenly a CONDUCTOR is next to Bart. 
CONDUCTOR 
Ticket, please. 
BART 
(FRIGHTENED) I don't have a ticket. 
CONDUCTOR 
Come with me, boy. 
The conductor drags Bart out the door and into the cab of 
the locomotive by his collar. Nonsensical and incorrect 


equations swim over Bart's head. The ENGINEER has his back 
turned, and is shoveling coal into the engine. 


Final Delivery - 5/31/89 - Page 10. 


CONDUCTOR (CONT'D) 
We've got a stowaway here, sir. 
BART 
I'll pay! How much? 
The Engineer turns around. It is Martin. 
MARTIN 
Twice the fare from Tucson to Flagstaff 
minus two thirds of the fare from 
Albuquerque to El Paso. (LAUGHS 
DEMONICALLY) 
Bart looks out the side window and sees a sign: "Santa Fe 
XX Miles". Principal Skinner is just finishing blacking 
out the number with red spray paint. He LAUGHS DEMONICALLY 
at Bart. 
Bart looks back inside the cab and sees he is alone. A 
TRAIN WHISTLE sounds. Looking out the front window, Bart 
sees the train from Santa Fe bearing down rapidly. Bart's 
eyes bug out. The WHISTLES become louder. 
BART 
Yaaaaahhh! 
The TRAINS SMASH into each other with an enormous CRASH, 
and the scene suddenly cuts back to the classroom. Bart 
has fallen straight back in his chair and is lying in it, 
arms straight out from his sides. 
MRS. KRABAPPEL 
Bart, there are students in this class 
with a chance to do well. Will you 
stop bothering them? 
MARTIN 
He's not bothering me, Mrs. Krabappel. 


I'm finished. May I go outside and 


read under a tree? 


Final Delivery - 5/31/89 - Page 11. 


MRS. KRABAPPEL 
Certainly, Martin. 
As Bart gets back up, Martin puts his paper back inside 
his test booklet and places it on the corner of 
Mrs. Krabappel's desk, within arm's length of Bart, and 
leaves. 
BART'S P.O.V. 
Bart looks out the window and sees Martin thumbing his nose 
and sticking his tongue out at him. An ugly-face duel 
ensues. 
MRS. KRABAPPEL (CONT'D) 
What are you looking at, Bart? Are 


those naughty dogs back again? 


Mrs. Krabappel goes to the window. She looks around for 
naughty dogs. 


MRS. KRABAPPEL'S P.O.V. 
Martin has returned to reading under the tree. 
BACK TO SCENE 
With lightning speed, Bart snatches Martin's paper off Mrs. 
Krabappel's desk, erases Martin's name from the top, writes 
in his own, and puts the paper back. Mrs. Krabappel sits 
down. 
MRS. KRABAPPEL (CONT'D) 

You have twenty minutes, class. 
Bart erases his own name from his test paper and writes in 
Martin's. He grins and, HUMMING A HAPPY TUNE, begins to 
fill in his answer sheet quickly and haphazardly. 
EXT. SCHOOL PLAYGROUND - LATER 


Homer and Marge are walking across the playground. 


Final Delivery - 5/31/89 - Page 


MARGE 
He's a good boy now, and he's getting 
better, and sometimes even the best 
sheep stray from the flock and need to 
be hugged extra hard. 
HOMER 
That's exactly the kind of crapola 
that's lousing him up. (NOTICES THE 
PICTURE OF THE PRINCIPAL) Hey, look at 
this! "I am a weiner." (CHUCKLES) He 
sure is! 
cur TO: 
INT. PRINCIPAL SKINNER'S OFFICE 


Principal Skinner is at his desk. Bart sits opposite hin, 
feet dangling nervously. 


SECRETARY 
(OVER INTERCOM) Mr. and Mrs. Simpson 
are here. 
SKINNER 
Send them in. 
Bart GULPS and cringes. 
BART'S P.O.V. - PARENTS 
They enter. 
MARGE 
Hello again, Principal Skinner. 
HOMER 
(TO BART) What have you done this 


time, boy? 


12. 


Final Delivery - 5/31/89 - Page 13. 


BACK TO SCENE 
SKINNER 
I caught your son defacing school 
property this morning. We estimate the 
damage at $75, and frankly, we think 
it's terribly unfair that other 
taxpayers should foot the bill. 
HOMER 
Yeah, it's a crummy system, but what 
are you gonna do? 
Marge WHISPERS into Homer's ear. 
HOMER 
Oh, no. He can't mean that. 
Marge nods. 
HOMER (CONT'D) 
My wife thinks you want me to pay for 
it. 
SKINNER 
That was the idea. 
HOMER 
Oh. 
Homer grimaces, glares at Bart, takes out a check and 
starts writing. The principal walks over to the file 
cabinet. 
SKINNER 
By itself something like this might not 
call for an extreme penalty... 


Skinner goes to the file cabinet, pulls out a drawer marked 
"Simpson, Bart" and takes out one of many files. 


Final Delivery - 5/31/89 - Page 14. 


SKINNER (CONT'D) 
..-but this is not an isolated 
incident. Bart's behavior is unruly. 
He's frequently absent from school, 
then gives teachers pathetic excuse 
notes... 
He takes a letter out of the file reading "Please excuse 
Bart. He was sick. Homer Simpson". It is written in an 
infantile scrawl. 
SKINNER (CONT'D) 
...that are obviously childish 
forgeries when compared to... 
He looks at the check for seventy-five dollars Homer has 
just given him. It is filled out in the same infantile 
scrawl. 
SKINNER (CONT'D) 
Well, at any rate, it is my reluctant 
decision -- 
SFX: INTERCOM BUZZES. 
SECRETARY 
(OVER INTERCOM) Mr. Skinner, Doctor 
Pryor is here to see you. He says it's 
urgent. 
SKINNER 
(INTO INTERCOM) Send him in. 


The district psychiatrist Dr. J. LOREN PRYOR, a large man 
with longish thinning grey hair and a beard, enters. 


SKINNER (CONT'D) 
Mr. and Mrs. Simpson, this our district 


psychiatrist, Dr. J. Loren Pryor. 


Final Delivery - 5/31/89 - Page 15. 


HOMER 
What do we need a psychiatrist for? We 
know our kid is nuts. 

DR. PRYOR 
Oh, on the contrary. I have some very 
exciting news for all of us. This 
aptitude test we administered this 
morning has revealed that the young 
Bart here is what we call a "gifted 
chila". 

HOMER 
A what? 

DR. PRYOR 
Your son is a genius, Mr. Simpson. 

MARGE 
Bart? 

HOMER 
This lunkhead? 

SKINNER 
Impossible. 

DR. PRYOR 
No, no, we're quite certain. The child 
is not supposed to know his own I.Q., 
of course, but, uh, you can see it is 
beyond the range of any doubt. 


He writes the number on a piece of paper and gives it to 
Homer. 


Final Delivery - 5/31/89 - Page 16. 


HOMER 
(AMAZED) Nine hundred and twelve? 
DR. PRYOR 
Uh, no, you have it upside down. It's 
two hundred and sixteen. 
HOMER 
(CRESTFALLEN) Oh. 
DR. PRYOR 
That's still amazingly high. 
Dr. Pryor takes a pair of calipers out of his jacket pocket 
and measures the width and height of Bart's head. He takes 
out a notebook and writes down the figures. 
DR. PRYOR (CONT'D) 


Tell me, Bart, are you ever bored in 


school? 
BART 
Oh, you bet. 
DR. PRYOR 
Uh hmmm... Ever feel a little 
frustrated? 
BART 


All the time, sir. 

DR. PRYOR 
Uh huh. Do you ever dream of leaving 
your class to pursue your own 
intellectual development on an 


independent basis? 


Final Delivery - 5/31/89 - Page 17. 


BART 
Wow, it's like you're reading my mind, 
man. 

DR. PRYOR 
(TO PARENTS) Aha... You see, when a 
child with Bart's intellect is forced 
to slow down to the pace of a normal 
person, he's probably going to lash out 
in ways (PICKS UP BART'S FILES) like 
these. 

SKINNER 
(ASIDE TO DR. PRYOR) I think we should 
re-test him. 

DR. PRYOR 
No, no, I think we should move him to 
another school. 

SKINNER 
Oh. Better yet. 

DR. PRYOR 
Bart, we'd like you to try a kind of 
school that doesn't rely on grades, and 
rules, and bells, and buzzers. (WAVES 
HIS HAND IN A DISMISSING FASHION) A 
school without walls. Where you do as 
much or as little of the assignments as 
you feel you need to. Does that sound 


good, Bart? 


Final Delivery - 5/31/89 - Page 18. 


BART 
Sign me up, Doc. 
DR. PRYOR 
Excellent. We're all set, then. 
Here's all the information you need. 
(HANDS BART SOME LEAFLETS) Show up 
around nine-ish. Mr. and Mrs. Simpson, 
congratulations once again. 
SKINNER 
I think we're all in a mood to 
celebrate. 
The Simpsons get up to leave. 
HOMER 
Doc, this is all too much. I mean, my 
son a genius -- how does it happen? 
DR. PRYOR 
Well, genius-level intelligence is 
usually the result of heredity and 
environment... 
DR. PRYOR'S P.O.V. - HOMER AND MARGE 
Homer is scratching himself. 
DR. PRYOR (CONT'D) 
Uh... Although in some cases it's a 
total mystery. 
INT. PRINCIPAL SKINNER'S WAITING ROOM 
The Simpsons exit the office with Dr. Pryor. Waiting 


outside are Martin Prince and his parents. There is a 
strong family resemblance. 


Final Delivery - 5/31/89 - Page 19. 


DR. PRYOR 
So long, folks! Take care of that 
brilliant boy for me! 


Martin looks at Bart with an incredulous expression. Bart 
gives him a happy wave. The Simpsons leave. 


DR. PRYOR (CONT'D) 
Oh, hello, Mr. and Mrs. Prince. Could 
I have a brief word with you in my 
office? 


They exit into a different office and shut the door. 
Martin picks up a book and starts reading. 


DR. PRYOR (CONT'D) 
(FROM INSIDE OFFICE) Folks, I have 
some bad news, but first let me say 
we're confident that if we start 
special vocational training classes 
immediately, Martin will someday be 
able to lead an almost normal life. 
INT. DISH WASHING CLASS 
There are a lot of kids, including Martin, at individual 


sinks wearing hair nets, rubber gloves, and aprons. 
They're all washing dishes. 


Final Delivery - 5/31/89 - Page 20. 


TEACHER 
Okay, once again, class, from the 
beginning! Dip and soak and scrub 
and -- Martin, could you show a little 
more enthusiasm, please?

ACT TWO 


FADE IN: 
INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - KITCHEN 


Lisa and Maggie are finishing their breakfast. Homer is 
on the phone. 


HOMER (CONT'D) 
(INTO PHONE) Hey, Barney, Homer 
Simpson. You'll never guess what my 
boy is... No! He's a genius! I don't 
know either. The psychiatrist says it 
is a total mystery. Bye. 
Bart and Marge enter. Bart is wearing a white shirt and 
his best pants. Marge is combing his slicked-down hair, 
parting it in the middle. 
BART 
Aw, come on, Mom. 
MARGE 
You look very intelligent, dear. 


BART 


No way. 


Final Delivery - 5/31/89 - Page 22. 


He musses his hair up so that it takes its normal shape. 
Bart resumes eating; pours himself a bowl of Frosty Krusty 
Flakes and begins eating. 
HOMER 
How about a tie, son? Everybody knows 
boy geniuses wear ties. 
BART 
(MOUTH FULL) You're stifling my 
creativity, Dad. 
HOMER 
Sorry, boy. 
MARGE 
Bart, this is a big day for you. Why 
don't you eat something a little more 
nutritious? 
HOMER 
Nonsense, Marge! Frosty Krusty Flakes 
are what got him where he is today. 
He picks up the box and reads the label. 
HOMER (CONT'D) 
It could be one of these chemicals here 
that makes him so smart. Lisa, maybe 
you should try some of this. 
MARGE 


Homer! 


Final Delivery - 5/31/89 - Page 23. 


HOMER 
I'm just saying, why not have two 
geniuses in the family? Sort of a 
spare in case Bart's brain blows up. 

LISA 
(TO BART; QUIETLY) I don't care what 
that stupid test says, Bart. You're a 
dimwit. 

BART 


(QUIETLY, TO LISA) Maybe so, but from 


now on, this dimwit is on Easy Street. 
They exit. 
cuT TO: 
EXT. HOMER'S CAR - MORNING 
Homer drives while Bart sits in back with his feet up. 
BART 
No rush, Dad. Take the scenic route. 
HOMER 
Gotcha! 
CUT TO: 
EXT. NEW SCHOOL 
Homer parks the car and walks up to the school with Bart, 
arm over his shoulder, as the other students are entering 
the building. 
INT. SCHOOL - HALLWAY 
Homer and Bart find the room labeled with a sign "Learning 


Center --Grade IV" in expert calligraphy. Bart looks 
through a window. 


Final Delivery - 5/31/89 - Page 24. 


BART'S P.O.V. 
All the boys have ties on. 
BART (CONT'D) 
Oh, no. Ties. 
HOMER 
Don't worry son, you can have mine. 
Here, let me show you how to put on a 
tie. 
He takes his tie off. It's a clip-on. 
HOMER (CONT'D) 
The hook goes over the top and these 
things go in there. 
BART 
Thanks, Dad. 


Without thinking, Homer kisses Bart. They stand there a 
minute looking at each other. 


BART 
You kissed me. 

HOMER 
There is nothing wrong with a father 
kissing his son, I think. Now go on, 
boy, and pay attention, because if you 
do, one day you may achieve something 
that we Simpsons have dreamed about for 
generations. You may outsmart someone. 


Homer pats Bart on the back and Bart enters the classroom.

INT. SCHOOL - CLASSROOM - DAY 
"Ms. Melon" is written on the blackboard. Through the 
glass section of the door Homer and Bart exchange a final 
wave, then Bart turns and faces the classroom. The room is 
large, with plenty of space for the dozen or so students, 
who are still milling about the room, talking in groups. 
The teacher spots Bart. She is young and pretty with 
glasses: a good-looking version of Mrs. Krabappel. 
MS. MELON 
You must be Bart Simpson. I'm 
Ms. Melon (PRONOUNCED ME-LAN), your 
learning coordinator. 
She walks him around the room as she talks. The room is 
full of the students' artwork, all of it impressive. 
Graceful vases are around the pottery wheel. Large 
abstract murals and cubist paintings are on the walls. 
They come to a stop at the bookcase. 
MS. MELON (CONT'D) 
Let me say right at the start that we 
have one rule here: make your own 
rules. If you feel sleepy, take a nap. 
If you get bored, feel free to take out 
a book and start reading. 
BART 
What should I read, m'am? 
MS. MELON 
Why, anything you want, Bart. 
BART'S P.O.V. 
Bart searches the bookcase and sees such titles as The 
Iliad," "The Odyssey," "Crime and Punishment," "Paradise 
Lost," and "Dante's Inferno." Suddenly his view zooms in 


on a "Radioactive Man" comic book. He picks it up and 
starts looking through it, but Ms. Melon snatches it away. 


Final Delivery - 5/31/89 - Page 26. 


MS. MELON (CONT'D) 
Well, how did this get mixed in here? 
We used it last week as a prop ina 
film we made about illiteracy. 
She tosses the comic book into a trash can and leads Bart 
to the cluster of desks. Two boys, SIDNEY and ETHAN, and a 
girl, CECILE, are sitting on the desks. The girl is

BART 
What? 
MS. MELON 
(WRITES ON THE BLACKBOARD) Ethan's 
very good with palindromes -- you know, 
sentences spelled the same backwards

Swift. 
SIDNEY

What's your problem?

MS. MELON 
Oh, don't mind Sidney. He's just 
speaking in backwards phonetics today. 
He said "Good morning, Bart." And this 
is Cecile Shapiro. 
CECILE 
Hi, Bart. 
Bart notices Cecile's hamsters. 
BART 
Cool. Hamsters! 
(TAPS ON CAGE) What are their names? 
CECILE 
(LOOKS PUZZLED) Hamster number one has 
been infected with a staphylococci 
virus. Hamster number two is the 
control hamster. 
BART 
Hi, li'l control hamster. 
MS. MELON 
I wouldn't get too attached, Bart. 
We're dissecting him next week.

Now, let's all welcome the newest 
member of our collective experience, 
Bart Simpson. 


The kids AD-LIB "Hellos" in various languages, backwards 
phonetics, and anagrams. 


MS. MELON (CONT'D) 
And now we can continue our debate from 
yesterday. When we left off, Calvin 
and Tanya were arguing that free will 
is an illusion. 
CALVIN 
The deal is, our decisions are based on 
experience, which comes mainly from a 
culture we didn't shape. 
TANYA 
And a family we didn't choose. 
Bart follows the discussion nervously. Looking around, he 
sees the students cooly considering the arguments, nodding 
or shaking their heads. Bart notices a girl across the 
room looking at him and drawing. 
CALVIN 
Yes, if you had, like, complete 
knowledge of a person's experience, you 
could predict nearly every decision a 


guy would make.

IAN 
If you ask me, humankind has freedom, 
a freedom fraught with paradoxes. Freud 
shows how childhood shapes our 
subconscious mind, but this helps us to 
think for ourselves. 

MS. MELON 
Very good, Ian. Does anyone else have 
an example of a paradox? (THEY ALL 
RAISE THEIR HANDS) 

ETHAN 
Without law and order, man has no 
freedom. 

CECILE 
If you want peace, you must prepare for 
war. 

MS. MELON 
Uh mnm, uh mmm... Well, it seems the 
smartest child in the class is also the 
quietest. Bart, what other paradoxes 
affect our lives? 

Bart is jolted to hear his name. 

BART 

Well... you're damned if you do and 


you're damned if you don't.

Yes, well, I guess that would be a

The gifted students eat in a small dining hall. At one 
table a group of students are eating sushi with chopsticks; 
one of them has a "Brideshead Revisited" lunch box. At 
another table Calvin takes a thermos bottle out of his 
“Anatoly Karpov" lunch box and opens it. Bart is sitting 
with Cecile, Sidney, Ethan, Ian and Calvin. He takes a big 
hero sandwich out of his Krusty the Klown lunchbox. 
CALVIN 
Tell you what, Bart! I'll trade you

Hurry up, get dressed! It starts at

The scene opens on the opera in progress on the stage. We 
see the PERFORMERS SINGING. We then see Homer, Marge, Bart 
and Lisa sitting in a box. 
BART 
Hey, Lis, keep an eye out for the guy 
with the peanuts. 
MARGE 
There ain't no guy with peanuts, dear. 
HOMER 
Jeez. No beer... no opera dogs...

SINGS along.

Both CHUCKLE, stop, then look at each other and start 
LAUGHING again. Lisa starts GIGGLING. Homer makes VULGAR 
NOISES by sticking his hand in his armpit. Marge buries 
her face in her hands. Bart makes VULGAR NOISES by putting 
his palms over his mouth and blowing.

INT. CLASSROOM - MORNING 
Ms. Melon is writing an extremely complex series of 
equations on the blackboard. There is a curve drawn on an 
x and y axis on an adjacent board. the final equation on 
the board is y=r3/3. 
MS. MELON 
So Y equals R cubed over three, and if 
you determine the rate of change in 
this curve correctly, I think you will 
be pleasantly surprised. 
After a second, all the students start LAUGHING QUIETLY 
except Bart, who returns a blank stare. Ms. Melon writes 
on the board as she explains it to Bart. 
MS. MELON (CONT'D) 
Well, don't you get it, Bart? 
Derivative D-Y equals three R squared 


DR over three, or R squared D R, or

Oh, no. 
HOMER 
Well, I guess we don't have to do that. 
BART 
Uh, look Dad, I got something to tell 
you. 
HOMER 
Can it wait, son? It's getting kinda 
dark. 
MARGE'S P.O.V. = OUT THE WINDOW 
Although it's getting a little dark, Homer and Bart are in 
the backyard playing catch under the porch light. Homer is 
making a stiff attempt at a pitcher's windup; he doesn't 
bend much at the waist and his front leg is straight when 
he raises it. Bart is squatting in a catcher's stance. A 
garbage-can lid is being used as home plate. 
EXT. SIMPSON'S BACK YARD 
A pitch comes in to Bart, still in the catcher's stance. 
BART 
All right, Homer, come on, baby. Right 
across the plate-- let me feel the 
wind.

Can you still see the ball, Bart? 
BART 
Don't worry, homeboy, you're not that 
fast. 
HOMER 
Oh, you don't think so, eh? Well, here 
comes some real heat. (GROANS) 
He gets back up in the catcher's stance. 
EXT. SIMPSON HOUSE - WIDE SHOT 
The darkening backyard is shown from a greater distance. 
In the light from the porch Bart and Homer are mostly 
silhouetted. Homer throws the pitch. 
BART 
Whoa! Yeah, strike three! You're

INT. NEW CLASSROOM —- LATER THAT MORNING 
Science class is in session. The students are all working 
in groups except Bart, who is alone at a table. Most of 
the students have test tubes over bunsen burners. Another 
group is dissecting a frog. 
Ms. Melon, carrying a clipboard, goes up to Ian, Cecile, 
and two other boys. They have a few test tubes out but are 
mostly working on paper. The tubes contain liquids of pure 
red and blue shades. 
IAN 
We're designing a structure to grow 
mercury iodide crystals in a zero- 
gravity environment more efficiently. 
CECILE 
If everything goes according to plan, 
NASA will include it on a future 
shuttle flight. 
MS. MELON 
Nice. Keep working. 
She moves on to Bart, who has by far the most humongous and 
confused set of test tubes, burners, rubber tubing and drip 
valves emptying into Pyrex measuring cups. All of the 
liquid in the various tubes and cups is bright green. Bart 
is wearing safety goggles. 
MS. MELON 
I'm still trying to get you a lab 
partner, Bart. If we don't get any 


volunteers soon, I'll assign somebody. 


Say, what's that? It looks dangerous.

what happens when you mix acids and 
bases, right? 
BART 
‘Course I do! 
EXT. SCHOOL BUILDING 
A beautiful sunny day. Birds are CHIRPING. A butterfly 
floats across the screen. Suddenly a flash lights up 
several of the windows in the school building and a LOUD 
EXPLOSION is heard from the room. Some smoke billows out 
from the open portions of these windows and green slime 
coats the rest. After a second or two, the school's fire 
bell starts to RING and children begin to file out of the 
building. 
INT. CLASSROOM 
Bart is standing at his table surrounded by Ms. Melon and 
the students. The room and everything and everyone in it 
are covered with the green stuff, every square inch. Bart 
is both green and singed. 
BART 
Sorry. 
INT. OLD SCHOOL - DR. PRYOR'S OFFICE 
Bart, still green and tattered, is sitting in a chair in 
front of the desk. The safety goggles are off, leaving a 
flesh-colored section around his eyes. Dr. Pryor is behind 


the desk. On the wall is a large photo of Albert Einstein. 
Next to it is a large photo of Bart.

DR. PRYOR 
Now Bart, we want to emphasize that 
nobody's angry about this. We're, 
we're just concerned. When a young man 
with a two hundred sixteen I.Q. can't 
make a simple experiment work, well, it 
doesn't take a Bart Simpson to figure 
out that something's wrong. Tell me, 
is the class moving too slowly for you? 

BART 
Lord, no. 

DR. PRYOR 
Well then what can we do to make you 
happy? 

BART 
I want to go back to my old class. 

DR. PRYOR 
Oh but, Bart, don't you remember the 
boredom... the ennui... the 
intellectual malaise? 

BART 
Yeah, well, you know...kinda... but I 
was thinking I could go undercover. 

DR. PRYOR 
Undercover? Bart, I'm intrigued. Go 


on.

Yeah.

Uh huh, this is most impressive, Bart. 
You write up your proposal while I talk

You know, outline your project, what 
you hope to achieve, what you'll 
require to do it.

Gotcha, man. 

Dr. Pryor exits. Bart takes paper and pencil from the top

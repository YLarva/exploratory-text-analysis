Bill Oakley & Josh Weinstein 
ACT ONE 
FADE IN: 
EXT. CENTER FOR GERIATRIC MEDICINE - DAY 
A banner says: "Grand Opening! Meet TV’s Matlock!" 
PULL BACK TO REVEAL a mob of very excited OLD PEOPLE 
milling about a makeshift stage in front of the building. 
GRAMPA and JASPER are at the rear of the crowd. 
DR. HIBBERT 
(INTO MICROPHONE) Welcome to the new 
Springfield Center for Geriatric 
Medicine. Health care for the aging is 
an important priority-- 
GRAMPA 
Get to Matlock! Maaaatlock! 
Jasper takes out an old, yellowed handkerchief and BLOWS 
HIS NOSE for five straight seconds. He puts the 
handkerchief back in his pocket. 
DR. HIBBERT 
Well, without further ado, I give you 
the man who puts young people behind 
bars -- where they belong -- TV’s 
"Matlock!" 
GRAMPA AND JASPER’S P.O.V. 
In the distance, we see a frail, HUNCHED-OVER OLD MAN 


shuffle onto the stage using two canes. The crowd of old 
people GOES WILD, a la 1964 Beatles fans. 


1F12 FINAL1 7/30/53 Page 2. 


OLD LADIES 
(SINGING) We love you, Matlock, oh yes 
we do... 


Some climb onto the stage and grab at his clothes and hair, 
knocking him over. 


INT. SENIOR CITIZENS’ MINIBUS - LATER 
Grampa is reading a pamphlet and looking gloomy. 
JASPER 
What’s eatin’ you, Abe? For three 
weeks, all you been talkin’ bout was 
meeting Matlock. Now you met him, 
swiped his pills... (READING BOTTLE) 
"Take one every hour to prevent spastic 
heart convulsions...” 
An ambulance ZOOMS past the minibus, sirens BLARING. 
JASPER (CONT’D) 
--- but y’ain’t said a word. 
GRAMPA 
According to this life expectancy 
chart, I shoulda been dead in 1971. 
JASPER 
(LOOKING AT PAMPHLET) Y/’old fool. 
That says 1981. 
GRAMPA 
Oh. (RELIEVED SIGH} 
INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY SCENE 2 


Grampa stands in the middle of the room, speaking to the 
family. 


1F12 FINAL1 7/30/93 Page 3. 


GRAMPA 
(RECITING) Hello. As you may know, I 
might not be around much longer, so 
I’ve decided te give you your 
inheritance before I die, that way I 
can see you enjoy it. Lisa, I know you 
like reading and... so forth... To you 
I give my lifetime of personal 
correspondence. 


He hands her a big stack of letters tied with a ribbon. 
She takes an old telegram off the top and reads it. 


LISA 
Thanks. (READING) "Mr. Simpson. 
Stop. Your constant letters are 
becoming a nuisance. Stop. If you do 
not cease, I will be forced to pursue 
legal action. Stop. Signed, Boris 
Karloff, Hollywood, California." 
GRAMPA 
For Bart, your first step on the road 
to manhood -- all my pipes and pipe 
tobaccy. 
He gives Bart a pipe rack and a large can of Prince Albert. 
GRAMPA 
And to my son, Homer... 
HOMER 


Woo hoo! 


1F12 FINAL1 7/30/93 Page 4. 


GRAMPA 
-.-And his entire family... 

HOMER 
(ANNOYED GRUNT) 

GRAMPA 
--.l leave these. A box of mint- 
condition 1918 Liberty-Head silver 
dollars. 


Grampa produces a cigar box full of shiny 1918 silver 
dollars and puts it on the coffee table. 


ANGLE ON GRAMPA 
GRAMPA (CONT’D} 

Ya see, back in those days, rich men 
would ride around in zeppelins droppin’ 
coins on people. And one day, I seen 
J.D. Rockefeller flyin’ by, so I run 
out of the house with a big washtub... 
Where’re you goin’? 


Grampa looks up to see the family at the door, putting on 
their coats. Homer has the box of coins. 


HOMER 
Dad, we’d love to stay here and listen 
to your amusing antidotes, but we have 
to take these coins to the mall and 
spend them. 

GRAMPA 
Nobody’s going nowhere! I paid good 


money for this attention. 


1Fl2 FINAL1 7/30/93 Page 5. 


The family GRUMBLES and sits down. 
GRAMPA (CONT’D) 
Anyway, about my washtub. I had just 
used it that morning to wash my turkey, 
which in those days was known as a 
"Walking Bird." 
INT. SPRINGFIELD MALL ~ MAIN LEVEL - LATER SCENE 3 
The family, including Grampa, walks past a coin shop called 
"The Ebullient Numismatist," which has a big sign saying 
"We Buy Rare Coins! Highest Prices for Silver Dollars!" 
INT. KIDS TOWN USA ~ BABY TOY SECTION 
Maggie is sitting at a kiddie table, playing with an Etch- 
A-Sketch. She is spelling out "M-A-G-G-I-E S-I-M-P-S- 
O..." Just as she’s finishing, Homer sets down a big toy 
on the Etch-A-Sketch, without looking. 
HOMER 
Look, Maggie! It’s Sgt. Thug’s 
Mountaintop Command Post, complete with 
Death-bringer missiles that really 
launch} 
MARGE 
(ANNOYED GRUNT) That toy isn’t safe 
for a baby like Maggie. 
HOMER 
Ah, come on, Marge, you’re way too... 
‘Homer picks up one of the pieces and cuts himself. He gets 
mad and HITS the Mountain, getting a severe ELECTRIC SHOCK 
and launching one of the plastic missiles straight into his 
mouth. We hear a muffled EXPLOSION which puffs out his 
cheeks. 


INT. KIDS TOWN USA - BORING AISLE 


Bart walks down a deserted aisle full of dusty toys. 


1F12 FINAL1 7/30/93 Page 6. 


BART 
Kites... Wood-burning set... AM Radio 
Kit... Oh man, who buys this crap? 
MARTIN 
Salutations, Bart! -- I’ve come to 
purchase a stained-glass making kit, 
but I’m in a quandary as to which one. 
(SHOWING THEM) Will it be the Bouquet 
of Balloons? Chilly Charlie the 
Penguin? 
BART 
They all pretty much suck. 
MARTIN 
(OBLIVIOUS) The Rainbow? Mother 
Goose? 
A skinny CHINESE MAN with glasses walks by. 
BART 
Uh, there’s my Dad. Gotta go. (RUNS 
AWAY) 
INT. KIDS TOWN USA - ANOTHER ANGLE SCENE 4 


Grampa is looking at toys on the shelves and talking to no 
one in particular. 


GRAMPA 
When I was young, toys were built to 
last! Look at this junk! It breaks 
the first time you take it out of the 


box! 


1F12 FINAL1 7/30/93 Page 7. 


Grampa takes a plastic rocket out of its box and bends it 
until it breaks. 


GRAMPA (CONT’D} 
And look at these toy soldiers! 
They’1l break the second I step on ‘em! 
(GRUNT) ...Stupid toy soldier... 
He lays some toy soldiers on the ground and starts STOMPING 
on them. Two SECURITY GUARDS come up and hustle a confused 
Grampa out the door. 
SECURITY GUARD 
All right, come on, pops. Soldiers 
won’t bother you anymore. 
INT. KIDS TOWN USA - ATRIUM 
Homer comes upon a giant, lighted piano inlaid on the 
floor, a la "Big." He inadvertently steps on one of the 
keys and is pleasantly surprised at the MUSICAL NOTE it 
plays. He takes a few more tentative steps and begins 
PLAYING A SONG. 
HOMER 
(PLAYING) One, two, three o’clock, 
four o’clock rock. Five, six, seven 
o’clock, eight o’clock rock!.. 
PEOPLE gather around. Seeing the crowd, Homer starts 
showing off and running up and down the keys, STEPPING on 
too many at once, etc. 
HOMER (CONT’D) 
Rock! Rock, rock, rock! Rockrockrock! 
He starts jumping on the keys, then lays down and slithers 
on them, making a swimming motion. The music is a HORRIBLE 


CACOPHONY that BLASTS through the mall. We see DOGS and 
CATS HOWLING inside the pet store. 


1F12 FINAL1 7/30/93 Page 8. 


HOMER (CONT’D) 
(BIG FINISH) We’re gonna rock, gonna 
rock around the clock TO-NIGHHHTTT! 
For the last note, he makes a running leap and lands on the 
keys with a LOUD CRASH. A network of cracks shoots through 
the shattered keyboard, and we hear EAR-SPLITTING FEEDBACK. 
ONLOOKERS 
Boo! 
HOMER 
(YELLING OVER FEEDBACK) Thank you, 
thank you very much! 
INT. KIDS TOWN USA - DOLL SECTION - LATER 
It’s an enormous aisle filled with dolls and frenzied 
LITTLE GIRLS. A sign says “Valley of the Dolls." Lisa and 
Marge round the corner, and Lisa sees a monolithic display 
of Malibu Stacy products. She looks at it, awed. 
LISA 
I’m warning you, Mom -- I may get a 
little crazy. 
MARGE 
I understand, honey. When I was your 
age there was a... 
Lisa has already disappeared into a mob of girls. 
LISA (0.S.) 
Hey, horse-face! Git yer ugly pie- 
hooks off that Summer Fun Set! 
ANOTHER ANGLE 
Girls are pawing through a bin labelled "Close-Outs." We 
see "Achy-Breaky" Stacy is $1.99. We see "Live from the 
Improv" Stacy is only 89 cents. It’s a Stacy making a zany 


face, holding a microphone, and wearing a T-Shirt with the 
"Comic Relief" logo. 


1F12 FINAL1 7/30/93 Page 9. 


ANGLE ON LISA 
Lisa is looking at "Crackpot Stacy," who is wearing a hat 
made of foil and holding a sign saying "Ask Me About the 
Trilateral Commission." A STOCKBOY carries in a big box 
and starts cutting it open. Little girls crowd around him. 
GIRL 
Hey, mister, what’s in the box? 
STOCKBOY 
(SQUEAKY TEENAGE VOICE) Um, it’s the 
new Talking Malibu Stacy. 


SHOCKED SILENCE as the girls (including Lisa) look at each 
other for a beat. Then, they all rush him. 


STOCKBOY (CONT’D) 
(CRIES OF PAIN) Help!! Mr. Weiss! 
INT. SIMPSON CAR ~- LATER 
The kids play with their new toys. We hear a BELL RING in 
the front seat. MOVE UP to reveal that Homer has a light 
bulb-powered E-Z Bake-style oven connected to the lighter. 
He takes a small cupcake out and tries to frost it while 
he’s driving. 
MARGE 
Hm. I don’t know if it’s a good idea 
to do that while you’re driving. 
HOMER 
Marge, that’s what I bought it for! 
IN THE BACK 


Bart is playing with his Sgt. Thug Mountaintop Command 
Post. 


GRAMPA 
Watch it, kid! You’1ll put out my real 


eye! 


1F12 FINAL1 7/30/93 Page 


Grampa pushes the Sgt. Thug set away, causing one of its 
missiles to shoot out the window. 


LISA 
Thanks for buying us these toys, 
Grampa. 
GRAMPA 
Bah. Why didn’t you get something 
useful, like storm windows or a nice 
pipe organ? (BEAT) I’m thirsty! Ew! 
What smells like mustard? There sure 
are a lotta ugly people in your 
neighborhood. Look at that one! 
Everyone is getting annoyed by Grampa’s complaining. The 
car pulls into the driveway, and everyone walks quickly 
into the house to get away from Grampa. He struggles to 
get out of the back seat. 
GRAMPA (CONT’D) 
Hello! I can’t unbuckle my seat belt! 
Hello? 
Grampa leans over and EONKS THE HORN repeatedly. 
INT. SIMPSON HOUSE ~ TV ROOM - &% FEW MINUTES LATER 
Grampa comes in the front door. 
GRAMPA 
There are too many leaves in your 
walkway! 
We hear two bedroom doors SLAM upstairs, and then we hear 
the blender TURN ON LOUDLY in the kitchen, drowning Grampa 
out. He sits down on the couch. A second later, Homer 
tries to sneak through the room without being noticed, but 
snags his foot in a telephone cord, pulling the phone off 


the table with a PROLONGED RINGING CLATTER. Grampa reels 
around.

iFi2 FINAL1 7/30/93 Page 


GRAMPA (CONT’D) 
Why are you pecple avoiding me? Does 
my withered face remind you of the grim 
specter of death? 

HOMER 
Yes. But there’s more. 


Homer puts his arm around Grampa and sits down on the couch 
with him. 


HOMER (CONT’D) 
Dad, I love you, but: you are a weird, 
sore-headed old crank and nobody likes 
you. 
GRAMPA 
Consarn it! (BEAT, THEN SAD) I guess 
I am an old crank. But what am I gonna 
do about it? 
ANGLE ON THE TV 
We see the end of a typical soda commercial in which old 
people become impossibly spry and hip just by drinking 
soda. They’re all dancing around and PLAYING ELECTRIC 
GUITARS. 
IP OLD MAN 
One sip and I’m totally hip! (PARTY 
HOWL) 
FREEZE FRAME. A logo comes up, sayings... 
BUZZ ANNOUNCER (V.O.)

He has been watching intently. 
GRAMPA 
(ALL FIRED UP) Hcly smokes, that’s it! 
From now on, I’m thinkin’, actin’, and 
lookin’ young! And I’m gonna start 
with a bottle of Buzz Cola! 
He grabs a bottle of Buzz from Homer and takes a huge swig. 
GRAMPA (CONT’D) 
(PANICKED) Ow! The bubbles are 
burning my tongue! Ow! Eh! Water, 
water! 
INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - LATER 
Lisa has made a small cardboard United Nations speaker’s 


podium and is setting up her Malibu Stacies of various 
ethnicities to be the General Assembly. Bart is playing 


nearby. 


LISA 
(DRAMATIC) A hush falls over the 
General Assembly as Stacy approaches 
the podium to deliver what will no 
doubt be a stirring and memorable 
address. (PULLS STRING) 

MALIBU STACY 
(DITZY) I wish they taught shopping in 
school! 

Lisa is visibly disappointed. She pulls the string again. 
MALIBU STACY (CONT’D) 


Let’s bake some cookies for the boys!

1F12 FINALi 7/30/93 Page 


LISA 
(TO DOLL) Come on, Stacy. I’ve waited 
my whole life to hear you speak. Don’t 
you have anything relevant to say? 
(PULLS STRING) 

MALIBU STACY 
Don’t ask me -- I’m just a girl! (DUMB 
GIGGLE) 

BART 
Right on! Say it, sister! 

LISA 
It’s not funny, Bart! Millions of 
girls will grow up thinking this is the 
right way to act! (BUILDING TO A 
FURIOUS CRESCENDO) That they can never 
be anything more than vacuous ninnies 
whose only goal is to look pretty, land 
a rich husband, and spend all day on 
the phone with their equally vacuous 
friends talking about how damn terrific 
it is to look pretty and have a rich 
husband! ! 

BART 
Just what I was gonna say. 

Enraged, Lisa hurls the doll out the window. 
EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS 


Grampa is riding down the street on a bike, flailing his 
arms.

GRAMPA 
Look at me! I’m actin’ young! Woooow! 
Malibu Stacy flies into the spokes of the bike, sending 
Grampa flipping over the handlebars and into a nearby 
cemetery where he disappears into an open grave. 
GRAMPA (0.S.) 
Eh. This ain’t so bad.

LISA 
(GROANS) Don’t you people see anything 
wrong with what Malibu Stacy says? 
GOOFY GIRL 
(SAD) Oh, there’s something wrong with 
what my Stacy says. (PULLS STRING) 
GOOFY GIRL’S STACY 
(DEEP MALE VOICE) My Spidey sense is 
tingling! (THEN) Anybody call for a 
web-slinger? 
LISA 
No, Celeste, I mean the things she says

The girls GIGGLE and cover their mouths. 
BECKY / JANEY 
Oooh! Lisa said a dirty word!

LISA 
They cannot keep making dolls like 
this! Something has to be done! 


The family keeps eating awkwardly. No one knows quite how 
to respond to Lisa. Finally, Marge puts down her fork. 


MARGE 
Lisa -- ordinarily, I’d say you should 
stand up for what you believe in, but 
you have been doing that an awful lot 
lately. 

BART 
Yeah, you made us march in that Gay 
Rights Parade. 


Bart holds up a newspaper with a prominent photo of him 
marching in the parade under the headline "Local Gays Show 


Their Pride." 


HOMER 
(BITTER) And we can’t watch Fox ‘cause 
they own those chemical weapons plants 
in Syria. 

LISA 
I can’t believe you’re just going to 
stand by as your daughters grow up in a 
world where this, (SHAKES DOLL) this is 


their role model.

(A BIT PEEVED) I had a Malibu Stacy 
when I was little, and I turned out all 
right. (GETTING UP) Now let’s forget

Maybelline people were very angry... 
EXT. HUGE INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX - DAY

Marge and Lisa, wearing pink hardhats, ride around in a

CLAIRE HARPER 

Welcome to Enchantment Lane, where all 

the parts come together and Malibu 

Stacy is born! Some folks say there is 

a little touch of fairy dust in the 

air. 
They drive into a huge, dreary room laced with metal tubes 
and chutes spewing out doll parts. SEVERAL UGLY MEN 


smoking cigarettes and wearing hair-nets cram the parts 
together to make Stacies. One of the chutes starts to clog 


up.

Leroy takes a dirty mop and jams it repeatedly into the 
blocked chute. 


INT. MALIBU STACY FACTORY - VISITORS CENTER - LATER 
Lisa and Marge watch a promotional film about Malibu Stacy.

CLAIRE HARPER 
Well, that’s the tour. If you have any 
questions, I’d be happy to-- 

LISA 
I have one. 

CLAIRE HARPER 
Yes? 

LISA 
Is the remarkably sexist drivel spouted 
by Malibu Stacy intentional, or is it 
just a horrible mistake? 

CLAIRE HARPER 
Believe me, we’re very mindful of such 
concerns. 


A man opens the door to an adjacent boardroom. We see it 
is filled with MIDDLE-AGED MALE EXECUTIVES.

It’s awful being a kid. No one listens 
to you. 
GRAMPA 
It’s rotten being old. No one listens 
to you. 
Homer enters. 
HOMER 
(CHIPPER) I’m a white male, aged 18-49. 
Everyone listens to me! No matter how 
dumb my suggestions are. 
He opens a cabinet and takes out a can labelled "Nuts & 
Gum--Together at Last!" He nods proudly, takes a handful, 
and walks out. 
LISA 
Well, I’m not going to accomplish 
anything just sitting here-- 
GRAMPA 
--And gripin’. It’s time for -- 
LISA 
Action! I’ve got to talk to that woman 
who invented Malibu Stacy and see if I

Do we sell (PUZZLED) “french fries?" 
INT. APARTMENT COMPLEX - HALLWAY - EVENING 


Lisa KNOCKS on an apartment door labelled "W. Smithers." A 
second later, a casually-dressed Smithers opens the door. 


SMITHERS 
Yes? Why, it’s Homer Simpson’s 
daughter. 
LISA 
I thought you might be able to help me 
get in touch with the inventor of 


Malibu Stacy. 


~'12 FINALL 7/30/93 Page 24. 


They go into Smithers’ apartment. 

SMITHERS 
Whew! That would be quite a feat. 
Stacy Lovell’s a total recluse -- 
hasn’t appeared in public in 20 years. 
Here, I’m writing an article on her for 
my next Malibu Stacy Newsletter. zt 
contains her last known whereabouts. 
I’ll - uh -print you out a copy. 

LISA

Smithers turns on the computer. Suddenly, a computer 
drawing of Mr. Burns appears on screen. 


BURNS 
(COMPUTER VOICE) Hello, Smithers. 
You’re quite good at turning me on. 
SMITHERS 
Um, you probably should ignore that. 
EXT. SPRINGFIELD GABLES STREET - DAY 
Lisa rides down the quiet suburban street on her bike, 
looking at the houses. Nearby, a man waters his lawn next 
to his mailbox, which reads: "SALINGER." A jacked-up, 
brightly-colored jeep with the license plate "PYNCHON1" 
ZOOMS up and TOOTS its horn, which PLAYS "La Cucaracha.” 
PYNCHON 
(TO SALINGER) Hey, Salinger! They’re 
having 2-for-1 Margaritas at El Torito 
tonight. Ya wanna come? 


SALINGER 


We went last night. 


1F12 FINAL1 7/30/93 Page 25. 


SALMAN RUSHDIE comes running out of a nearby house. 
RUSHDIE 
(EXCITED) Hey, guys! Is it time for El 
Torito? 
ANGLE ON LISA 


Her attention is caught by an unusual-looking house behind 
a large, imposing gate. 


LISA 
No, it couldn’t be... 
She stops and takes a Malibu Stacy catalog out of her 
knapsack. A CLOSE-UP reveals that this house looks exactly 
like Malibu Stacy’s Dream House. Lisa parks her bike and 
goes up to an intercom on the gate. She musters her 
courage and pushes the button. 
LISA (CONT’D) 
Excuse me. Miss Lovell? I’d like to 
talk to you about Malibu Stacy. 
OLD WOMAN (V.0O.) 
(DIGNIFIED VOICE) Do you have any idea 
how many kids have tried to track me 
down and-- 
LISA 
Am I the first? 
OLD WOMAN (V.0.) 
(UNCOMFORTABLE PAUSE) Yes. 
LISA 
I want you to hear what Malibu Stacy is 


telling a generation of little girls. 


She pulls out the Talking Malibu Stacy and pulls the 
string.

MALIBU STACY 
Thinking too much gives you wrinkles. 
After a pregnant pause, the hydraulic gates slowly and 
SQUEAKILY swing open. Lisa starts to enter. A YOUNG MAN 
in shorts and a T-shirt also runs in. 
YOUNG MAN 
All right! I’ve been waiting nine 
years to get my Frisbee back! 
He grabs his Frisbee out of a bush and runs back out. The 
gates close. A moment later we see the Frisbee fly over 
the wall, back into the yard.

ACT THREE 
FADE IN: 
INT. STACY LOVELL’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY SCENE 12 
STACY LOVELL is an attractive older woman with a polished 
demeanor, a la Lauren Bacall. She sits with a cocktail, 
examining the Talking Malibu Stacy with a look of concern. 
MALIBU STACY 
My name is Stacy, but you can call me 
(WOLF WHISTLE). 
STACY LOVELL 
I see exactly what you mean. This is a 
problem. But what do you expect me to 
do? 
LISA 
Change what she says. It’s your 
company. 
STACY LOVELL 
Not since I was forced out in 1974. 
They said my way of thinking just 
wasn’t cost effective. 


LISA 
That’s awful! 


STACY LOVELL 
Well, that, and I was funneling 


profits to the Viet Cong. 


1F12 FINAL1 7/30/93 Page 28. 


LISA 
But you are Malibu Stacy, and as long 
as she has your name, you have a 
responsibility. I’d be mortified if 
someone ever made a lousy product with 
the Simpson name on it. 

STACY LOVELL 
I may have had things in common with 
Stacy in the beginning, but thirty 
years of living her lifestyle taught me 
some very harsh lessons. Five 
husbands... 


She points to photos of her five husbands on the mantel. 
They resemble various famous male dolis. 


STACY LOVELL (CONT’D) 
Ken, Johnny, Joe, Dr. Colossus, Steve 

Austin... 

LISA 
But if you can learn from Malibu 
Stacy’s mistakes, so can everyone. I’m 
sure we can think of something 
together. C/’mon! 

STACY LOVELL 
Eh. Not now, I’m too drunk. 

LISA 
No you’re not! (TAKES A SECOND LOOK) 


I’1ll come back tomorrow.

INT. KRUSTYBURGER ~ DAY SCENE 13 


The Dorky Teenage Manager talks to Grampa and a SULLEN 
YOUNG EMPLOYEE. 


MANAGER 
(SQUEAKY TEENAGE VOICE) We need more 
secret sauce. Put this mayonnaise in 
the sun. 


He points to several big gallon jugs of mayonnaise and 
exits. 


GRAMPA 
(FRISKY) Hey! Now that old man 
Peterson’s off our backs, let’s have 
some fun! 
Grampa turns his back for a moment, then turns back 
around with a hamburger bun with his dentures in the 
middle. He operates it like a puppet. 
GRAMPA 
Ever see a sandwich that could take a 
bite out of you? 
The oblivious sullen young employee mechanically takes 
the burger, wraps it up, and hands it through the drive- 
thru window to a waiting CUSTOMER who drives away. 
GRAMPA (CONT’D)

INT. STACY LOVELL’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM ~ THE NEXT DAY 


Lisa takes a drawing out of her knapsack and shows it to 
Stacy. 


1F12 FINAL1 7/30/93 Page 30. 


LISA 
I’ve got the solution -- you and I are 
going to make our own talking doll. 
She’ll have the wisdom of Jeanne 
Kirkpatrick and the wit of Cathy 
Guisewite, the tenacity of Nina 
Totenberg and the common sense of 
Elizabeth Cady Stanton. And to top it 
off, the down-to-earth good looks of 
Eleanor Roosevelt! 

STACY LOVELL 
(THINKS, THEN SUDDENLY MANIC) Alright, 
we’ll make your doll! 


There is a loud knock at the front door, and Stacy opens it 
to reveal GI JOE standing there. 


GI JOE 
Stacy, please, I must have you back. 
Just come for a ride with me in my 
mobile command unit. 
He grabs her arn. 
STACY LOVELL 
Joe, I told you. It’s over. Release 
me from your kung fu grip. 
GI JOE 
Fine. I’11 bomb your house into the 
ground, missy. 
He walks off stiffly. 


MONTAGE of the making of the doll.

1) INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY SCENE 14 
The family watches as Stacy Lovell sits at the table 
carving a clay model of the doll with sculptor’s tools. 
Lisa takes Marge’s measurements. 
MARGE 
I’m very flattered to be the model for 
your doll. I wonder if this is how 
Cheryl Tiegs got started. (GIGGLES) 
BART 
Mom, we like your joke, but please stop 
saying it over and over. 
LISA 
Make sure you get my Mom’s hair just 
right. 
STACY LOVELL 
Um, I think we’ll use someone different 
for the hair. 
LISA 
(POINTING TO HER HAIR) How about me? 
STACY LOVELL 
{HESTITANT NOISE) There’s something 
not quite... 
BART 
How about me?

You all have hideous hair! (COVERING) 
I mean from a design point of view. 
2) INT. RECORDING STUDIO 
Lisa stands in a sound booth, recording sayings for her 
talking doll from a book of quotations. Stacy Lovell and a 
very bored TECHNICIAN sit in the control room. 
LISA 
(GRANDLY) "... mais seulement pour les 
coeurs des femmes." Let me try that 
again. 
TECHNICIAN 
(INTO INTERCOM) Uh, look, little girl, 
we got a lot of other dollies to record 
today. Okay? 
KRUSTY struts into the sound booth, wearing shorts, polo 
shirt, and baseball cap and smoking a cigar. Ignoring 
Lisa, he grabs the microphone. 
KRUSTY 
Alright you poindexters, let’s get this 
right. (READING FROM CARD, VERY QUICK)

The technician turns around from putting a tape on the 
recorder.

ready to roll any... What the --— 
3) INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT SCENE 15 
We hear "Tucker"-style MUSIC as the family and Stacy Lovell 
work in a little production line. Marge takes freshly 
baked dolls out of the oven. Lisa, wearing a welder’s 
mask, pours steaming liquid plastic into doll molds. 
LISA 
(SURVEYING THE SCENE) Wow! This is 
just how the Malibu Stacy corporation 
got started. 
STACY LOVELL 
Actually, it started with a million 
dollar loan from a Dutch venture 
capital group. (BEAT) But this way is 
good, too. 
Lisa finishes filling the molds. 
4) INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY 


The family and Stacy admire a platoon of completed dolls. 
Lisa smiles and pulis one of the doll’s strings. 


DOLL 
(LISA’S VOICE) Trust in yourself and 
you can achieve anything. 

LISA 


All right! Now all we need is a name. 


1Fl12 FINAL1 7/30/93 Page 34. 


BART 
How about "Blabbermouth -- The Jerky 
Doll for Jerks?" 
LISA 
(IGNORING BART) How about "Minerva," 
after the Roman goddess of wisdom? 
STACY LOVELL 
Hmm, not enough commercial appeal. 
BART 
"Wendy Windbag"?. "Ugly Doris"? 
"Hortense: The Mule-faced Doll"? 
STACY LOVELL 
I think we should name her after Lisa. 
We’ll call her "Lisa Lionheart." 
BART 
No! “Loudmouth Lisa!" 
Everyone is ignoring Bart. 
BART (CONT’D) 
“Stupid Lisa Garbageface!" (BEAT) I 
can’t stand this any longer! Somebody 
please pay attention to me! 


Bart starts charging through the house SCREAMING and 
kicking things in a hyperactive frenzy. 


BART (CONT’D) 
Hello! Look at me! I’m Bart! I’m 
Bart! Look at me! etc.

Everyone is loading the completed, packaged dolls into 
boxes. Bart stands by, shuffling his feet.

helping, I’m helping! Look at me! 
EXT. SIMPSON HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - CONTINUOUS 
Bart walks out carrying a big box marked "DOLLS." Just 
that minute, a tour bus drives by with a banner saying 
"“Muntz Family Reunion." NELSON and his ENTIRE FAMILY see 
Bart carrying the box of dolls. 
NELSON’S ENTIRE FAMILY 
(AS ONE) Haw haw! 
INT. KRUSTYBURGER - MANAGER'S OFFICE - DAY SCENE 16 


Grampa sits as the DORKY TEENAGE MANAGER reads out of a 
binder labelled "Disciplinary Procedures." 


MANAGER 
(SQUEAKY TEENAGE VOICE, UNEASY) Abe, 
your job performance has been 
substandard and I am placing you on 
probation until further notice. 
GRAMPA 
Wha-at?! You can’t talk to me like 
that. I’m going to call your mother! 
MANAGER 
(PANICKED) No! No! You’re doing fine. 
Seriously, don’t call her, okay? Okay, 


dude?

INT. KIDS TOWN USA - DOLL SECTION - DAY 


Stacy Lovell, Lisa and Homer stand by proudly as a stockboy 
sets up a display of the Lisa Lionheart doll. 


LISA 
This is great! They’re really gonna 
sell our doll. 

STACY LOVELL 
Well, it wasn’t difficult. I told them 
who I was, and who you were, and they 
couldn’t resist. 

LISA 
Really? 

STACY LOVELL 
Well, I didn’t tell them who you were. 


The stockboy finishes with the display and turns toward 
Homer. 


STOCKBOY 
Hey, aren’t you the dude who wrecked 
our giant piano? 

HOMER

Homer runs and hides inside a large doll house. A second 
later, he peers furtively out the window. ;

Lionheart display.

Gentlemen, we’ve got to sink this doll, 
fast. It’s time to call in a favor 
from Washington. 
ESTABLISHING SHOT - U.S. CAPITOL - NIGHT 
INT. SENATOR’S OFFICE ~ CONTINUOUS 


A CORRUPT-LOOKING SENATOR, a la the one in "Godfather II," 
listens grimly on the phone. 


SENATOR 
Yes... Yes... I understand... I’1ll take 
care of it personally. 
EXT. SIMPSON HOUSE - STREET - NIGET 
A sinister-looking limousine cruises down the street. Its 
rear window rolls down, the Senator leans out, and hurls a 
rock at the Simpson house. It hits the side of the house 
with a THUD. 
SENATOR 
(SELF-SATISFIED EVIL LAUGEH) 
The limousine PEELS OFF. 
LISA (0.S.) 
Dad, did you hear something? 
HOMER (0.S.) 
I’unno. 
INT. KENT BROCKMAN’S HOUSE - DEN - NIGHT 
KENT BROCKMAN is working at his old roll-top desk, typing 
a newscast on his manual typewriter. His sleeves are 
rolled up and he’s smoking -- he looks very reporterly. 


His SEVEN-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER comes up, carrying a Lisa 
Lionheart doll. 


1F12 FINAL “/30/93 Page 38. 


BROCKMAN’S DAUGHTER 
Dad, my new doll’s much better than 
Malibu Stacy. Do a newscast about her! 

KENT BROCKMAN 
(CHUCKLE) Please, honey, Daddy’s job 
is to bring people important news. 
Right now I’m very busy preparing a 
report about the fortieth anniversary 
of Beetle Bailey. 

BROCKMAN’S DAUGHTER 
Oh, Daddy, that’s boring! Talk about 
the dolly! 

KENT BROCKMAN 
(THINKS) Well... You were right about 
the Berlin Wall. 


He yanks his newscast out of the typewriter and tosses it 
it into the trash. 


INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - THE NEXT NIGHT 
The family watches the newscast. 
ON TV 


Kent Brockman is winding up. Behind him is a mortise of 
Lisa’s doll with the caption "New Doll." 


KENT BROCKMAN 
Though it was unusual to spend 28 
minutes reporting on a doll, this 
reporter found it impossible to stop 
talking. It’s just really fascinating 


news, folks. Goodnight. 


1F12 FINAL1 7/30/93 Page 3 


The credits roll and we hear the CLOSING NEWS THEME. 
Brockman looks casually at his papers. 


KENT BROCKMAN (CONT’D) 
Oh. And the President was found naked, 
hiding in the top of the Washington 
Monument. More on that tomorrow after 
part six of my interview with Yahoo 
Serious. 
INT. SOMEWHERE - NIGHT 
CLOSE-UP of the news ending onscreen. A hand reaches in 
and switches off a VCR, and the screen goes black. PULL 
BACK TO REVEAL that we are in the boardroom of the Malibu 
Stacy factory, where the executives have been watching a 
tape of the newcast. 
GRIM C.E.0. 
Our one effort to put a stop to this 
thing has failed miserably. Gentlemen, 
we have to change Malibu Stacy. We’ll 
stay here all night if need be.

OLD LADY CUSTOMER 
These eggs are difficult to digest. I 
want soft-boiled eggs. 
GRAMPA 
I told you we don’t have soft boiled 
eggs. If you -- (THINKING) ...By gum, 
you’re right, we should have ‘em! I 
shouldn’t be listening to complaints, I 
should be makin’ ’em with you guys. 
The good Lord lets us grow old for a 
reason: To gain the wisdom to find 
fault with everything he’s made! My 
place is on the other side of this 
counter, and here I come!

Suddenly, the doors slide open and the mob BURSTS into the 
store. 


INT. KIDS TOWN USA - DOLL SECTION - CONTINUOUS 
Everyone dashes wildly towards the Lisa Lionheart display. 
Just as they’re about to reach it, a stockboy wheels a cart 
directly into their path; it’s loaded with crates labelled 
"New! Malibu Stacy Plus." The stockboy starts unpacking 
then. 
GIRL #1 
Oh, my god, they changed Malibu Stacy! 
GIRL #2 
(GASP) Look, she’s got a hat! She’s 
better than ever! 
We see Malibu Stacy Plus is just a regular Malibu Stacy 


wearing a floppy felt hat with a flower on the front. Lisa 
runs to the front of the crowd. 


1Fl2 FINAL1 7/30/93 Page 42. 


LISA 
Wait! Don’t be fooled! She’s just a 
regular Malibu Stacy with a stupid 
cheap hat! She still embodies all the 
awful stereotypes she did before. 
Smithers sticks his head out from the rear of the crowd. 
SMITHERS 
(POINTING) But she’s got a new hat. 
GIRLS 
(BEAT, THEN) I wannit! I wannit! / 
New hat! / etc. 


Everyone starts RIPPING open crates and grabbing Malibu 
Stacy Pluses. 


INT. KIDS TOWN USA - DOLL SECTION - LATER SCENE 19 
Lisa, Homer, Marge and Stacy Lovell stand dejectedly around 
the doll aisle. The Malibu Stacy displays have been picked 
almost clean, but the Lisa Lionheart display sits 
completely untouched. 
LISA 
Well, I guess you can’t beat big 
business. There’s just no room for the 
little guy. 
HOMER 
Well, we little guys still have a few 
tricks up our sleeves. 
Homer takes a Malibu Stacy, opens the box, and spits 


inside. Lisa manages a weak smile and they start to walk 
away. Suddenly...

DOLL (0.S.) 
(LISA’S VOICE) Trust in yourself and 
you can achieve anything. 


They wheel around to see a little girl holding a Lisa 
Lionheart doll. The little girl smiles. 


LISA 
(TOUCHED) You know, if we get through 
to just that one little girl, it will 
all be worth it. 

STACY LOVELL 
(LOW) Yes. Particularly if that 
little girl happens to pay $46,000 for 
that doll. 

LISA 
What? 

STACY LOVELL 
Oh, nothing. Kudos to you, Lisa! 
Kudos! 

INT. KIDS TOWN USA ~- ATRIUM - A MINUTE LATER 


The family and Stacy Lovell are walking out. Lisa looks 
much happier. Homer sees something.

you’ll excuse me, I’ve got something 


very important to attend to. 


1F12 FINAL1 7/30/93 Page 44. 


Homer dashes over to the newly-repaired giant piano and 
begins JUMPING AROUND on it. SEVERAL ALARMED CLERKS run 


up and try to pull him off. Despite their efforts, he 
manages to stomp out the SIMPSONS CLOSING THEME. On the 


last note, it BREAKS.

long veil. 


MARGE 
Kids, we're late for church. Get your

INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - TOP OF STAIRS 
The kids emerge. MAGGIE wears a bonnet in a somber color, 
LISA is wearing a Sunday dress and BART wears a blazer with 
his hair slicked down. Lisa and Maggie scamper down the 
stairs followed by Bart who slides down the bannister and 
lands on his ass with a GRUNT. 
LISA 
Ready for inspection, Mon. 
Marge adjusts Maggie's bonnet. 
MARGE 
Very nice, Maggie. And Lisa you 
look lovely. (LESS FRIENDLY) 
Bart, assume the position. 


Bart turns and places his hands on the wall. Marge frisks 
him removing a slingshot, a comic book and dice.

INT. CAR ~- MORNING 
MARGE 
Homer, why should I feel like a traffic 
cop every Sunday morning when I'm just 
trying to get a little goodness into 
the family. 


Homer turns on the radio and is BLASTED by HEAVY METAL 
MUSIC. Bart is bopping to an unheard rhythn. 


HOMER 
(IRRITATED GRUNT) Where is it. The 
game... where is it? 


While pushing the pre-set radio stations, Homer puts the 
car in reverse and recklessly backs into the street. 


EXT. ROAD = MORNING 

We HEAR a radio going back and forth between CHURCH MUSIC 
and FIERY SERMONS as the car meanders nearly out of 
control. 

INT. CAR - MORNING 

Homer finally finds the game on the radio. 


HOMER

Homer HONKS his horn and FLASHES his lights. Marge lets 


out an annoyed murmur.

Bart is still bopping to unheard music. 
MARGE 


C'mon everybody, we're late. 


Bart, I 


want you to promise me you'll pay 


attention in Sunday school. 


Bart? 


Bart? (LOUDLY) BART!! (VERY LOUDLY) 


BART 
Are you talking to me? 


MARGE 


(GASPS) What's this? A personal 


stereo? Were you going to listen to 


rock music in Sunday school? 


AS RECORDED - 7/31/89 6 


Maybe. 


She yanks the headphones off his head. Bart's ears wiggle 
and we HEAR TINNY ROCK 'N ROLL MUSIC. 


MARGE (CONT'D) 
Can you believe this, Homer?... 
Homer?...Homer? 
Marge turns. 
MARGE'S POV 
Homer is still in the car listening to the game. He is 
pounding his head on the steering wheel. Marge goes back 
to the car in a huff and opens the door dropping the 
headphones on the front seat. 
HOMER 
Oh no, no. We stink, we stink! 
MARGE 
Homer! Were you planning on sitting in 
the car till the game was over? 
HOMER 
Maybe. 
MARGE 
It's because of your irreverent 
attitude that Bart thinks he can sneak 
headphones into Sunday school. 
HOMER'S POV 


Homer's eyes widen as he sees the headphones on the front 
seat looking very tempting. 


MARGE 


Now, move it!

Lisa and Bart's room. Bart is sitting next to MILHOUSE. 

JANIE 

Will my dog, Pepper, be there? 
TEACHER 

I'm sorry but the answer is no. 
JANIE 

(SADLY) Why not? 
TEACHER 

Because heaven is for people. 
LISA 

What about my cat, Snowball? 
TEACHER 

I'm sorry but the answer is no. 
MILHOUSE 

Will there be cavemen in heaven? 
TEACHER 

Certainly not. Well, they were 

practically animals. 
BART 

Uh mam, what if you're a really good 

person but you're in a really, really 

really bad fight and your leg gets 

gangrene and it has to be amputated; 


will it be waiting for you in heaven?

beatific smile on his face. 


REVEREND LOVEJOY 

And now I'd like to begin today's 

sermon which I have entitled, 

"Gambling, the 8th Deadly Sin." Today 

is Sunday, the Lord's day and yet, at 

this very moment, millions of Americans 

are not in the Lord's house. They're 

in their own house worshipping a false 

idol, professional football. Oh 

Lord... 
BEHIND HOMER'S HEAD 
We no longer hear the Reverend. Instead we HEAR the 
FOOTBALL GAME Homer is listening to on the headphones. 
Remarkably, the Reverend's gestures coincide with the 
announcer's remarks. 

RADIO ANNOUNCER #1 (V.O.) 

It's a beautiful Sunday. Perfect 

football weather for this incredible 

game. And by the way, this game is 

brought to you by the good people at 

Duff Beer. You can't get enough of 

that wonderful Duff. 


Reverend Lovejoy gestures sternly.

RADIO ANNOUNCER #1 (0.S.) 
Now, they're lining up for this crucial 
kick. One final tick of the clock 
remains. If they win, it will cap an 
amazing comeback. It's a 49 yard field 
goal into the wind. 
Reverend folds his hands and leads the congregation in 
prayer. Homer folds his hands and prays fervently for the 
field goal. 
HOMER 
Make it, make it, make it, make it. 
RADIO ANNOUNCER #1 (V.O.) 
The kick is up it's got the distance. 
Holy toledo, it's good! 
HOMER 
Please, please, please, please, please. 
We HEAR fans EXULTING in b.g. 
BACK TO WIDE SHOT 


The Reverend gestures with both his hands raised above his 
head. 


HOMER 
(SHRIEKING EXULTATION) (LEAPING TO HIS 
FEET AND SHOOTING BOTH FISTS OVER HIS 
HEAD) It's good! It's good! It's 
good! 
The Reverend stops speaking and all look at Homer. 
HOMER 


It's good to see you all in church.

heaven, but the dummy doesn't. 
BART 
Oh, oh, oh, me. 
TEACHER 
Bart. 
BART 
What about a robot with a human brain? 
TEACHER 
I don't know. All these questions... 
Is a little blind faith too much to 
ask?

Homer away and the family walk toward 
MARGE 
Homer, you embarrassed us in front of 
the whole congregation, and today's 
sermon was one you should have really 
listened to. 
HOMER 
What was it about? 
MARGE 


Gambling. 


is the car. 


AS RECORDED - 7/31/89 12 


HOMER 
Oh! He didn't by any chance say that 
under certain circumstances it was 
alright, did he? 
The family gets into their car. 
INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS 
MARGE 
No! Look, I don't want to talk about 
this any more in front of the kids. 
Lisa, Bart, what did you two learn in 
Sunday school today? 
LISA 
The answers to deep theological 
questions. 
BART 
Yeah. Among other things, apes can't 
get into heaven. 
HOMER 
What! Those cute little monkeys? 
That's terrible. Who told you that? 
BART 


Our teacher. 


AS RECORDED - 7/31/89 13 


HOMER 
I can understand how they wouldn't let 
in those wild jungle apes, but what 
about those really smart ones who live 
among us who roller skate and smoke 
cigars? 


Bart is looking out the window and sees on a movie marquee 
SPACE MUTANTS 4: THE TRILOGY CONTINUES. 


BART 
Ah, cool, man. Space Mutants 4. Drop 
me off! Drop me off! 
MARGE 
No way, Jose. 
HOMER 
Marge. They're only space mutants. 
MARGE 
I know what those movies are like. 
Killing innocent people, eating human 
flesh. (TO BART) You just get a lot of 
bad ideas. 
CUT TO: 
INT. HOUSE - A LITTLE LATER 
Homer lies on couch in his suit. Bart enters. 
BART 


Hey, Dad. Can I have five bucks? 


AS RECORDED - 7/31/89 14 


HOMER 
(WINKS) I hope you're not planning to 
see a certain movie starring certain 
space mutants that a certain mother 
didn't want you to see? 
(CHUCKLES) 
BART 
(CHUCKLES) Perish the thought. 
HOMER 
Here you go, son. Share the wealth, 
that's what I always say. 
HOMER 
(SHARPLY) Beat it, boy. 
Bart takes his money and walks upstairs. As he goes 
towards his room, he sheds parts of his clothing. He is 
naked for a beat then he puts on his regular clothes as he 
continues walking. 
EXT. SIMPSON HOUSE - DAY 
Bart comes out of bedroom window carrying skateboard. He 
grabs some rope and swings a la Tarzan to the ground which 
sends him zipping down the sidewalk. Bart does a series of 
stunning acrobatic skateboard tricks, including jumping 
garbage cans, rail-sliding, wallees, etc. 
BART 
Da da da da da da de de de Whoa! Ugh, 
Cowabunga!

BART 
It didn't hurt. 
KEARNY 
Oh yeah? Well, do it again. 
BART 
Nah. I might land on my face and end 
up looking like you. 
Jimbo LAUGHS. 
KEARNY 
You little punk. 
Kearny starts menacingly towards Bart. Jimbo stops him. 
JIMBO 
Hey man, leave the kid alone. I like

Wow man, you don't need an 
introduction. You're the worst kid in 
school. 
JIMBO 
Thanks. 
BART 
I'd like to hang with you, but I'm late 
for the movie. 
KEARNY 
Well, stick around. We'll get you in 
at a discount. 
DOLPH peeks out the side exit of the theatre. 
DOLPH 
Psst. Coast is clear. 
BART 
(SHOCKED) You guys are sneaking in? 
KEARNY 
Yeah. Only saps pay to see movies. 
JIMBO 
Hey Bart, come on. 
BART 
But sneaking into a movie is 


practically stealing. 


AS RECORDED - 7/31/89 17 


Practically? 
JIMBO 
It is stealing. 
BART 
Well, okay. I just wanted to make sure 
we weren't deluding ourselves. 


Jimbo grabs Bart and yanks him inside. The theatre door 
closes behind then.

Wait, I think I hear something. 
BOY ON SCREEN 
Come on, loosen up, baby. There's 
nobody here but you and me. 
GIRL ON SCREEN 
No. Stop it, I think I hear 


something... not human. 


Bart makes a rude NOISE by pressing his palms against his 
face and blowing. The kids ROAR. 


BOY ON SCREEN 
Don't tell me you believe those crazy 
rumors about flesh-eating space 
mutants. Come on, Baby, let's get

On screen a giant hideous SPACE MUTANT comes up from the 
back seat of the car. 


GIRL ON SCREEN 
(SCREAMS ) 
Tentacles wrap around both teenagers' necks, asphyxiating 
them gruesomely. Teenagers on screen SCREAM and make 
HORRIBLE CHOKING NOISES. Bart and Kids LAUGH and CHEER. 
Suddenly from behind them a large USHER appears like the 
Space Mutant did, grabbing Bart and Jimbo, who SCREAM. 
USHER 
You little sneaks. You're coming with 
me. 
EXT. THEATRE 
The kids come flying and stumbling out the front door. 
USHER

Quick-E-Mart.

Squishees and one double jumbo 
original flavor. 
CLERK 
Okay. (TO KIDS) Now, don't you kids 
take anything. I'm watching you. I've 
got eyes in the back of my head. 
He turns to get the Squishees. While his back is turned, 
the kids (except Bart) are stuffing their pockets with 
things. Occasionally he turns back to check them. They 
stop immediately. He brings the Squishees to Bart. 
CLERK (CONT'D) 


Four fifty two.

Bart grabs all four Squishees (in souvenir Space Mutant 
cups) and exits. 


EXT. STREET 
Jimbo, Kearny, Dolph and Bart walk along eating cinnamon 
candy, looking at “PLAYDUDE" magazine, and eating beef 
jerky. 
BART 
Hey, guys, where'd you get all that 
great stuff? 
DOLPH 
Five finger discount, man. 
BART 
Ripped it off? 
JIMBO 
Yeah! Thanks for covering for us, man. 
On the way to the park, the kids pass the eight foot statue 
of Jebediah Springfield, the city's founder, standing 
victoriously with his foot on a dead bear's head. The 
three punks toss rocks at it, hitting a different spot with 
a different resounding CLANG. 
JIMBO 


Ugh! Go on, Bart. 


AS RECORDED - 7/31/89 22 


BART 
But that guy founded Springfield. He 
built our first hospital out of logs 
and mud. If it weren't for him all the 
settlers would have died in the great 
blizzard of forty eight. 

JIMBO/DOLPH/ KEARNY 
So...? 

BART 
(HESITANTLY) So...watch me hit him 
right between the eyes. 


He heaves a rock which strikes the statue right in the 
forehead. 


BILL DANDY steps out of his store ("Candy Most Dandy"). 
MR. DANDY 
Hey. What are you doing there? Show a 


little respect, you insolent little 


thugs. 

DOLPH 
Oooh.

The kids are lying in the grass, SLURPING on their drinks, 
eating their stuff, looking at the clouds. 


KEARNY 
You know, when you look up at clouds in 
the sky they start looking like stuff. 
DOLPH 
No, they don't. 
KEARNY 
Yeah, they do. Like that one over 
there looks just like a cherry bomb. 
DOLPH 
Hey, you're right. And look at that 
one. It looks like a guy with a 
switchblade stuck in his back. 
JIMBO 
Yeah! That one looks like a school bus 
going over a cliff in flames with kids 
inside screaming. 
(NOTE: The clouds greatly resemble the objects described.) 
BART 
That one looks like the statue of our 
town founder, Jebediah Springfield. 
DOLPH 
Does not. 
BART 
Does too. I mean without the head, of 


course. 


AS RECORDED - 7/31/89 24

I wish someone really would cut his 
ugly old head off. 
BART 
You do? 
KEARNY 
Yeah. That'd be cool. 
DOLPH 
Sure would cheese everybody off. 
BART 
But guys, come ons Don't you remember 
history class? Jebediah once killed a 
bear with his bare hands. 
DOLPH 
(SARCASTIC) Oh. Sorry. 
KEARNY 
We forgot how much you love Jebediah 
Springfield. 
JIMBO 
Yeah. He's your boyfriend. 
BART 
He is not! 


Dolph and Kearny make KISSING SOUNDS at Bart.

Bart sadly trudges back to the house. 
INT. SIMPSON'S KITCHEN <- EVENING 
Homer is looking through a bowling ball catalog, entitled 
"THE BOWL EARTH CATALOG". He's licking his chops. Maggie 
sits in her highchair SUCKING and watching hin. 
HOMER 
(TO MAGGIE) Wow! Look at all these 
bowling balls, Maggie. Can you think 
of a better way for Daddy to spend 
fifty bucks? 
MAGGIE 
(SUCKS) 
He turns another page and GASPS. 
HOMER (CONT'D) 
Now I've seen everything. Black 
marblized with a liquid center. The 
"Stealth Bowler" -- the pins don't know 
what hit ‘em. 
Bart enters through front door. 
BART 
Dad, can I talk to you about something? 
HOMER 


Sure, boy. What's on your mind? 


AS RECORDED - 7/31/89 26 


BART 
Well... I was wondering... how 
important is it to be popular? 

HOMER 
I'm glad you asked, son. Being popular 
is the most important thing in the 
world. 

BART 
So like sometimes you could do stuff 
that you think is pretty bad so other 
kids will like you better? 

HOMER 
(KIDDING) You're not talking about 


killing anyone, are you? 


BART 
No. 
HOMER 
ou? 
BART 
No. 
HOMER

mischief is like a bowling ball without 


a liquid center.

INT. BART'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 


MISSION IMPOSSIBLE-style music PLAYS over entire scene. 
Bart gets out from under the covers dressed like a Ninja 
warrior. He sneaks out of his room and peeks into his 
parents' bedroom. They are asleep -- Homer has fallen 
asleep with the bowling catalog over his face. Bart sneaks 
downstairs into the basement. He grabs a hacksaw from his 
father's workbench. He holds the saw up and we see it 
GLINT. Bart sneaks out of the house stepping on the cat's 
tail as he passes. As the cat YOWLS, Bart clamps his hand 
over its mouth and shushes it. The cat runs away. 


EXT. VARIOUS STREET LOCATIONS - NIGHT 


Bart sneaks along in his Ninja outfit. He passes through 
the deserted town. Past the Quick-E-Mart and Candy Most 
Dandy. He steps into a large menacing shadow. We PULL 
BACK to REVEAL he is in the shadow of Jebediah Springfield. 


BART'S POV 


We see the statue in forced perspective. We ZOOM onto its 
head. 


BART 


He gets a determined expression, climbs up the statue and 
starts to saw its neck. SFX SAWING. 


WIDER SHOT OF SQUARE 
Bart continues to saw. 


LONG SHOT OF SPRINGFIELD. We HEAR some faint SAWING NOISES 
and then the resonating CLANG of the unseen head hitting

INT. BART'S BEDROOM - MORNING 
We are CLOSE UP on Bart who is sleeping. Some morning 
light crosses his face. He awakens. He woozily turns and 
SCREAMS as he reacts to something 0.S. We PULL BACK 
revealing that Jebediah Springfield's head is on the pillow 
next to him. : 
MARGE (0.S.) 
Bart, are you all right? 
BART 
Oh yeah. Top of the world, Ma. 
MARGE (0.S.) 
Well then come down for breakfast. 
INT. KITCHEN - MORNING 
The radio is PLAYING Mambo music. Homer is eating a 
sausage with his fingers, dipping it in egg yolk and then 
dropping it down his gullet. He is still reading his 
bowling catalog. 
HOMER 
Oooh. Look at this one. "The Hammer 
of Thor. It will send your pins to 
(WITH DIFFICULTY) Valhalla." Lisa? 
LISA 
Valhalla is where Vikings go when they 
die. 
HOMER 


Ooooh, that's some ball. 


AS RECORDED - 7/31/89 29 


Bart enters and puts down his knapsack with a resounding 
THUD. It is obvious to us that the head of the statue is 
inside. 
BART 
(EXTRA CHEERY) G-o-o-o-d morning, 
everybody. 
RADIO ANNOUNCER #3 (V.O.) 
We interrupt Mambo in the Morning to 
bring you this special news bulletin. 
The statue of Jebediah Springfield, our 
illustrious town founder, was brutally 
decapitated last night in an act of 
senseless vandalism. We now go to 
Police Chief Wiggum at City Hall. 
On the radio there is an angry DIN in the b.g. 
POLICE CHIEF WIGGUM (V.0.) 
Well, we have no witnesses, no suspects 
and no leads. If anyone has any 
information, please dial "oh" and ask 
for the police. That number again, 
oh. 
RADIO ANNOUNCER #3 (V.0.) 
Stay tuned to this station for further 
developments as they break. 
Upbeat MAMBO MUSIC continues. Over the preceding 
announcement the Simpsons all look horrified except for 
Bart, who looks a little taken aback. 
HOMER 
This is horrible.

MARGE 
What's this world coming to? 
BART 
Ah, come on man, it's just a statue. 
MARGE 
It's a statue of the trailblazing 
founder of our town 
LISA 
It's a symbol of what we can all do if 
we put our minds to it. 
HOMER 
Just a statue? Is the Statue of 
Liberty just a statue? Is the Leaning 
Tower of Piza just a statue? 
HONKING outside. 
BART 
Uh-oh. School bus. 
Lisa sits stunned at the table. 
BART (CONT'D) 
C'mon Lis. School bus. 
Bart grabs his heavy knapsack and exits. 
MARGE 
Go on, Lisa. We've all got to be brave 
just like Jebediah when he killed that 
bear. 
Lisa sadly gets up and follows Bart out the door. Marge 


steps over to Homer and puts her arm around him to comfort 
hin.

MARGE 
There, there, dear. 
INT. SCHOOL BUS - MORNING 
Bart and Lisa get on the bus. OTTO is leaning over the 
wheel misty-eyed. The other KIDS on the bus AD LIB: 
“What's the matter, Otto", "Otto, are you okay?", etc. 
Otto removes his headphones. 
BART 
Hey Otto. What's wrong? 
OTTO 
Some dude sawed off Jebediah 
Springfield's head. School's been . 
cancelled. Go back to your homes. 
(SOBS) 
The kids file off the back of the bus. 
LISA 
There, there, Otto. 
BART 
I didn't know you felt that way, man..

Springfield's statue on his stomach.

BARNEY

EXT. OLD FOLK'S HOME - DAY 
The flag is at half mast. A dozen OLD MEN sit on the porch 
shaking their heads and muttering to themselves. AD LIB: 
"It's a crime", "What's this world coming to", etc. 
GRANDPA 
I've said it before and I'll say it 
again: Hell in a handbasket. I hope 
they find the punk who did this and I 
hope they cut his head off. 
All the old men AD LIB agreement. 
INT. CANDY MOST DANDY - DAY 
Mr. Dandy is mindlessly eating candy to cheer himself up. 
There is a big pile of candy boxes behind him. He is 
watching a small portable television. We see an image of 
the headless statue. A CROWD of hundreds stands vigil 
outside at the statue. 
TV ANNOUNCER #2 
The people of Springfield are stunned. 
They are staggering through the streets 
as if they lost their own heads. 
We PULL BACK REVEALING that although Mr. Dandy is watching 


the scene on television, the actual scene is visible in the 
big picture window behind hin.

outside carrying his knapsack. He looks around nervously 
at the pain he has wrought.

Jimbo, Dolph and Kearny are lying on the grass next to a 


“KEEP OFF 


THE GRASS" sign. 

JIMBO 
Boy, I'd sure love to meet the guy that 
cut off the head of that statue. 

DOLPH

Bart walks up. 


He starts

Hi guys. What's up?

BART 
Oh, really?

AS RECORDED - 7/31/89 34 


JIMBO/DOLPH 
Yeah, man. 

BART 
What? (ZIPS THE BAG SHUT) But, but 
yesterday didn't you say it would be 
cool to cut off the head and really 
cheese everybody off? 

DOLPH 
I don't remember what I said yesterday. 

KEARNY 
That was just cloud talk, man. 

JIMBO 
Yeah! I mean throwing rocks at a 
statue is one thing, but I'd never cut 
the head off of a guy who iced a bear 
with his bare hands? 

JIMBO 
So what's in the bag, Bart? 


A disembodied VOICE comes from Bart's knapsack. It rustles 
slightly. 


JEBEDIAH (FROM INSIDE BAG) 
My head. 
Bart looks at the knapsack, aghast. 
JIMBO 
I said, what's in the bag, Bart? 
JEBEDIAH (FROM INSIDE BAG) 
Go ahead, Bart. Tell them. It's the 
head of Jebediah Springfield.

JIMBO 
What's wrong with you, Simpson? 
Bart pales. 
BART 
Ahh! Nothing. I gotta go. 
EXT. STREET 
Bart nervously heads home crossing back through the vigil, 
past the headless statue. Hundreds of townsfolk carry 
lighted candles. 
JEBEDIAH (FROM INSIDE BAG) 
Look what you've done. You wanted to 
be popular. Now you're the most hated 
boy in town. 
BART 
You're not really talking to. me. 
You're just my overactive imagination. 
JEBEDIAH (FROM INSIDE BAG) 
Oh, I an, am I? 
PAN with Bart has he crosses past Burns, Smithers, Moe and 
Dandy, among the other mourners. They look at him 
suspiciously. 
BART (CONT'D)

to like me. 
BURNS

rattled.

INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM 
Bart crosses through Living Room. Lisa and Maggie, 
clutching her bankey, are watching "Krusty The Clown" on 
TV. 
LISA 
Hey Bart, where you going? 
BART 
To my room. 
LISA 
Why don't you watch "Krusty The Clown"? 
BART 
No thanks.

Bart walks over to the TV. 


AS RECORDED - 7/31/89 37 


ON TV 


KRUSTY is talking to SIDESHOW BOB, a wildman of Borneo-type 
who talks through the use of a slide whistle. 


KRUSTY 
Sideshow Bob, did you hear the news 
about Jebediah Springfield's head? 

SIDESHOW BOB 
(BLOWS SLIDE WHISTLE DOWN) 

KRUSTY 
But it's okay. We'll find the bad 
person who did it. 

SIDESHOW BOB 
(BLOWS SLIDE WHISTLE UP) 

KRUSTY 
And that's where you come in, boys and 
girls. There is someone out there in 
Krustyland who has committed an 
atrocity. If you know who it is, I 
don't care if it is your brother, your 
sister, your daddy, or your mommy -- 
turn them in... and Krusty will send 
you a free whistle just like Sideshow 
Bob's.

EXT. SIMPSONS! BACKYARD 


Bart is digging a hole in the ground in which to bury the 
head. 


JEBEDIAH 
Wait a minute. I hope you're not 
planning to do what I think you're 
doing. 
BART 
Sorry, man. It's either you or nme. 
JEBEDIAH 
You know, Bart, you don't have to found 
a town to be a hero. Sometimes a hero 
can be a young boy with the courage to 
stand up and admit he's made a mistake. 
BART 
Thanks, man. I'll remember that. 


Bart pushes the head in the hole. Lisa comes out of the 
house. 


LISA 
What are you burying this time? 


Lisa sees the head and SHRIEKS. Bart clamps his hand over 
her mouth. 


AS RECORDED - 7/31/89 39 


BART 
Oh, Lisa. I made a terrible, terrible 
mistake. It's such a relief to be able 
to talk to somebody about this... 
besides him. 

LISA 
Bart, it's entirely up to you and your 
conscience whether you tell Mom and 
Dad, but in six minutes I'm going to 
tell them myself. 


Lisa turns on her heel and returns to the house. Bart

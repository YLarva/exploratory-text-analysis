BART VS. THANKSGIVING 
by 


George Meyer 


FADE IN: 
INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING 
MARGE is in the kitchen, her arm buried in a big 
Thanksgiving turkey. HUMMING "We Gather Togeher", she 
repeatedly removes large amounts of disgusting-looking 
turkey innards. PAN through the kitchen to... 
INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Homer is relaxing in his recliner watching television. We 
PAN by SNOWBALL II and SANTA'S LITTLE HELPER, both sleeping 
blissfully. Still PANNING we come upon another peaceful 
tableau: BART attempting to smother LISA with a huge sofa 
cushion. Her SCREAMS are muffled as she flails her limbs 
trying to get free. 
HOMER 
Bart! Stop fighting with your sister! 
BART 
She took my glue! 
Lisa shoves Bart and the cushion off her. 
LISA 
It's not yours, Bart! This is family 


glue! 


TABLE DRAFT 5/15/90 PAGE 2. 


HOMER 
Stop it you two! This is Thanksgiving! 
And if you can't glue friendly, I'll 
take the glue away from both of you and 
then no one will have any glue to glue 
with! 
LISA i 
Dad, this isn't about glue. It's about 
territoriality. ‘He only wants the glue 
because I'm using it. If I offered it 
to him, he wouldn't even want it! 
BART 
Yeah? Prove it! 
Lisa hands Bart the glue. 
LISA 
Here. 
BART 
Hey, man, I don't want your stupid 
glue. 
Bart tosses the glue aside. 
CLOSE-UP - MAGGIE 
The bottle of white glue lands upright next to her bottle 
of milk. They look very similar. Maggie looks back and 
forth between the glue bottle and the milk bottle trying to 
decide which to take. Just as she is about to reach for 
the glue, Lisa grabs it and heads upstairs. 


HOMER WATCHING TV 


A helium-filled Popeye goes by, followed by a thirty foot 
Bullwinkle balloon with one deflated antler. 


TABLE DRAFT 5/15/90 PAGE 3. 


HOMER 
(LAUGHS) Nice antler, Bullwinkle. 
BILL and MARTY are the unctuous announcers. 
MARTY (V.O.) 
And here comes our friend, Bullwinkle 
J. Moose... 
BILL (V.O.) 
(RE: ANTLER) Uh-oh... it looks like 
ol' Bullwinkle... kinda got a taste of 
his own medicine! 
MARTY (V.O.) 
He certainly did, Bill! 
BILL (V.O.) 
(TO SELF) Wait, what did that mean? 
Did what I say make sense? 
MARTY (V.O.) 
Well... no... not really, Bill! 
BILL (V.O.) 
(CHUCKLES) Boy, now I know how the 
Pilgrims felt. 
MARTY (V.O.) 
What are you talking about, Bill? 


Bart joins Homer. Bullwinkle is still visible on the 
screen as a balloon of Underdog comes up behind him. 


BART 
Who the hell is that? 
HOMER 


Bullwinkle. 


TABLE DRAFT 5/15/90 PAGE 


BART 
Who? (BEAT) Wait a minute, who's that? 
HOMER 
Underdog! Don't you know anything? 
BART 
I know it wouldn't hurt ‘em to use some 
cartoons made in the last fifty years. 
. HOMER 
Son, this is tradition. If you start 
building a balloon for every flash-in- 
the-pan cartoon character, you'd turn 
the parade into a farce. 


As Homer is saying the above, we see Bart balloon go by on 
the TV behind hin. 


INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - STAIRWAY 
Maggie crawls up the stairs, deftly avoiding safety 
hazards: A frayed, sparking extension cord, Bart's 
skateboard, a gardening tool with sharp prongs. 
INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - LISA'S BEDROOM 
Lisa is working on an elaborate mixed-media project. We 
see paints, papier mache strips, glue, etc. She hears a 
THUD, opens the door and Maggie falls in with another THUD. 
LISA 

Maggie, I'm glad you're here. I'm 

about to unveil my centerpiece to the 

family! 
The centerpiece looks like the traditional cornucopia 
spilling out fruits and vegetables. But on each of the 


bigger vegetables is perched a carefully-crafted female 
historical figure. 


TABLE DRAFT 5/15/90 PAGE 5. 


LISA 
See? What I'm trying to convey here is 
that along with the traditional riches 
of the soil (POINTS TO FRUIT) we should 
also be thankful for some trailblazing 
women, whose work enriches our souls... 
(INDICATING) See, there's Georgia 
O'Keefe... Susan B. Anthony... and this 
is Marjorie Stoneman Douglas. I'm sure 
you haven't heard of her, but she 
worked her whole life to preserve the 
Florida Everglades. 

MAGGIE 
(SUCKS PACIFIER) 

LISA 
As one of the Simpson women, would you 
like to contribute something to it? 


Lisa hands Maggie a crayon and Maggie draws a few random 
lines on it. 


LISA (CONT'D) 
(HUGS MAGGIE) Thank you. 
INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - KITCHEN 


Marge is making the stuffing in a big bowl. She goes to 
the refrigerator, bumping into Bart. 


MARGE 
Honey, please. You're in the way. 
BART 


Can't I help you, Mom? 


TABLE DRAFT 5/15/90 PAGE 6. 


MARGE 
Well, okay. Let's see... Can you do 
the cranberry sauce? 

BART 
Yeah! I'll do everything... Uh, where 
is it? 

MARGE 
The can is in the cupboard on the 
bottom shelf. (DIRECTING HIM) No, the 
other shelf. It says "cranberry 
sauce." 

Bart finds the can. 

BART 
Got it. Now what? 

MARGE 
Open the can. 

BART 
With a can opener? 

MARGE 
Yes, sweetheart. 

BART 
No problem. Where is it? 

MARGE 
It's in the second drawer from the 
right. 


Bart BANGS the drawers open and closed. 


TABLE DRAFT 5/15/90 PAGE 7. 


MARGE (CONT'D) 
No, the right. The other one. 
BART 
Oh, I got ya. 


Bart finds the can opener and tries to work it, as Marge 
returns to the stuffing. 


BART (CONT'D) 
It's broken, Mom. (NO RESPONSE) Mon, 
it's broken. (LOUDER) Mom, it's t 
broken. (SINGING) Mom, it's broken. 
Mom, it's broken. 
MARGE 
(SLIGHTLY ANNOYED) Oh, honey, You're 
using the bad one. Here, let me do 
it... 
Marge reaches into frame, taking the can of cranberry 
sauce. We HEAR her quickly open the can and then hand it 
back to Bart. He then removes the top, PLOPPING the 
contents into a waiting dish. 
BART (CONT'D) 
Ah, cranberry sauce a la Bart. 
Bart exits. We stay on cranberry sauce. 
MARGE (0.S.) 
Just stick it in the refrigerator when 
you're done. Bart. Bart? 


With an annoyed MURMUR, Marge picks up the cranberry sauce 
and puts it in the refrigerator. 


INT. BIMPBON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM 


Homer is watching the football game. Maggie crawls by. 
Homer picks her up and puts her on his knee. 


TABLE DRAFT 5/15/90 PAGE 8. 


HOMER 
See, Maggie? Those silver and blue 
guys are the Detroit Lions. They're 
Daddy's favorite team, and he wants 
them to lose by less than six and a 
half points. Understand? 
ANNOUNCER, #1 (V.O.) 
(ON TV) Kogen's got Wolodarsky open 
and it's complete!... Ooooh what a hit! 
ANNOUNCER #2 (V.O.) 
He's out cold, Gil. 
ANNOUNCER #1 (V.O.) 
Yup. Looks like they'll be feeding him 
Thanksgiving dinner through a tube. 
ANNOUNCER #2 (V.O.) 
Hope they can fit a turkey in there! 
They CHUCKLE. Marge sticks her head in. 
MARGE 
Homer, shouldn't you go pick up Grampa? 
HOMER 
Plenty o' time, Marge. 
MARGE 
Homer... 
ANNOUNCER #2 (V.O.) 
There's thirty-three ticks left in the 
half. 


TABLE DRAFT 5/15/90 PAGE 9. 


HOMER 
. Marge, I'll be ready to go in thirty- 
three seconds. 
We HEAR the front door open. 
PATTY (0.S.) 
Ding-dong! 
SELMA (0.S.) 
(HUMS BUGLE CALL) Here comes the 
cavalry! 
MARGE 
(CALLING) Patty! Selma! (TO HOMER) 
Homer, Patty and Selma are here! 
HOMER 
(ANNOYED GRUNT) 
MARGE 
Homer, you promised. 
HOMER 
I'll be nice. I'll be nice. 


INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - FOYER 


PATTY and SELMA enter with armloads of covered dishes. 
Marge joins then. 


MARGE 

(IRRITATED) You brought food...? 
PATTY 

(INDICATING DISHES) Just a few 


things... Swedish meatballs, stuffed 


grape leaves... 


em OE ne ee Oe 


TABLE DRAFT 5/15/90 PAGE 10. 


SELMA 

Mmm-hmm. And creamed onions... 
PATTY 

Mmm-hmmm, and my trout almondine. 
MARGE 

(ANNOYED MURMUR) 

Homer enters. . 

HOMER 

Hi, Patty. Hi, Selma. 


Homer attempts to air kiss them, but they back away, 
MURMURING greetings. 


HOMER 
Gee, everything smells great. (BEAT) 
Well, gotta pick up my old man! Happy 
Thanksgiving! 
Homer goes out the front door. 
SELMA 
(TO PATTY) So insincere. 
PATTY 
(TO SELMA) I don't know how she puts 
up with hin. 
INT. CAR - DAY 


Homer is mimicking Patty and Selma in a wordless, sing- 
songy MUMBLE. He turns on the radio to listen to the GAME. 


TABLE DRAFT 5/15/90 PAGE 11. 


ANNOUNCER (V.O.) 
And now, get set for our fabulous half- 
time show, featuring the well-groomed 
young go-getters of "Hurray for 
Everything!" 
HOMER 
Oh, nooo! I love them! They always 
put on such a good show! 
ANNOUNCER (V.O.) 
Ladies and gentlemen... "Hurray for 
Everything" invites you to join them in 
a salute to the greatest hemisphere on 
earth... the Western hemisphere! The 
dancin'-est hemisphere of all! 
MUSIC: "Get Dancin'" by Disco Tex and the Sex-o-lettes. 
INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - KITCHEN 


Patty and Selma are busily heating and arranging their 
dishes. 


PATTY 
We'll just stay on this side of the 
kitchen. 

SELMA 
Mmm-hmm. 

MARGE 
(DEADLY TONE) You knew... I was 
cooking... a turkey. 

PATTY : 


Which is fine! 


TABLE DRAFT 5/15/90 PAGE 12. 


SELMA 
More power to ya! 
PATTY 
It's just that some people find your 
turkey a little dry. 
SELMA 
Mmm-hmm, and if they want an option... 
they'll have it. 
MARGE 
(ANNOYED MURMUR) 
EXT. SPRINGFIELD RETIREMENT HOME - DAY 


Homer pulls into the parking lot. On the radio, the HALF- 
TIME SHOW is winding up. 


ANNOUNCER (V.O.) 

And this Silverdome now ablaze with 
flashbulbs, as "Hurray for Everything" 
leaves the field! Of course, a 
stadium's much too big for flash 
pictures to work, but nobody seems to 
care! 

INT. RETIREMENT HOME - DAY 


Homer passes a sign that reads, "Thank You For Not 
Discussing the Outside World." 


INT. RETIREMENT HOME - DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 


Homer enters the dining room where a GROUP of listless 
oldsters sit awaiting their Thanksgiving dinner. A 
SUPERVISOR stands at the front of the room addressing the 
group. 


TABLE DRAFT 5/15/90 PAGE 13. 


SUPERVISOR 
Now, before we sit down to our 
delicious turkey puree, I have some 
happy news. The following people have 
relatives who wish they could be here 
today: (READS COMPUTER PRINTOUT) 
Antonowski, Bernstein, Chavez, Conroy, 
Falcone, Martin... 
The nearby fax machine starts printing out a page with 
HARSH MECHANICAL SOUND. The Supervisor glances at the 
sheet. 
SUPERVISOR (CONT'D) 
(TO LADY) Oh, and Mrs. Walsh... you 
too. 
MRS. WALSH 
(MISTY-EYED) I knew they wouldn't 
forget me! 
Homer approaches GRAMPA. 
HOMER 
Come on, Dad. Let's get out of here. 
Homer takes Grampa by the arm and starts to hustle him out. 
GRAMPA 
Slow down, boy. What's your hurry? 
HOMER 
This place is depressing. 
GRAMPA 


Hey, I live here! 


TABLE DRAFT 5/15/90 PAGE 14. 


HOMER 

(COVERING) Well, I'm sure it's a blast 

once you get used to it. Let's go. 
EXT. SIMPSON HOUSE - DAY 
A cab pulls up in front of the house. The DRIVER gets out 
and opens the curbside door, but his passenger, Marge's 
MOM, gets out on the opposite side. 
INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - KITCHEN i 
Marge, Patty and Selma are each squirting the roasting bird 


with huge turkey basters. Their Mom hobbles in through the 
side door. o 


MARGE 
Mom! You made it! How are you! 
MOM 
(HOARSE WHISPER) I have laryngitis and 
it hurts to talk, so I'll just say one 
thing: You never do anything right. 
INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - LISA'S BEDROOM 
Lisa adds a few finishing touches to her masterpiece with 
an ultrafine brush, then blows off a few motes of dust. 
It's finally ready. 
INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM 
We are CLOSE UP on the fireplace. We see a fire blazing. 
We PULL BACK and see that the fire is just a small corner 
of a piece of wood in the fireplace. Homer is pumping 
bellows trying to get the fire going as Grampa watches. 
There are dozens of burnt matches scattered around. 
HOMER 
(PUMPING BELLOWS) See that! See that! 


Won't be long now! 


TABLE DRAFT 5/15/90 PAGE 15. 


GRAMPA 
That's no way to lay a fire! Where's 
your kindling? 
HOMER 
This thing's gonna be roaring any time 
now! 
We PAN to Selma and Patty looking on. 
PATTY 
That's what he's been saying for an 
hour. 
SELMA 
Even a caveman could start a fire. 
MARGE (0.S.) 
Dinner time! Dinner, everybody! 
Everyone scrambles to the table. 
HOMER 
(RE: FIRE) Screw this. 
He throws down the bellows and runs to the table. 
INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - DINING ROOM - A LITTLE LATER 
All the adults and Maggie are seated at the table. 
MARGE 
(CALLING) Okay, Lisa, we're ready for 
your centerpiece! 


A hush falls. Lisa enters and proudly places the 
centerpiece on the table. 


MARGE (CONT'D) 
Lisa! My goodness! That's very 


impressive! 


TABLE DRAFT 5/15/90 PAGE 16. 


HOMER 
Holy moly! That's the biggest one of 
those I ever saw. 


The others AD LIB admiring remarks, “Oh my!" "She's so 
talented!", etc. 


SELMA 
How long did that take you, honey? 
LISA 
I couldn't tell you how many hours. It 
was a labor of love. You see, on this, 
perhaps the most American of holidays, 
I wanted to pay homage to some patriots 
who may not have fought in any wars but 
who nevertheless... 
Bart enters, HUMMING a fanfare. 
BART 
Da da daah da da dah daaahhh... 
HOMER 
Speaking of heroes, here's mine... Tom 
Turkey! 
Homer REVS the electric knife excitedly. Lisa and Marge 
exchange a sympathetic look. Everyone "OOOHS" and "AAHS" 
at the turkey. Bart looks for a place to set down the 
platter, finds none and starts to elbow the centerpiece 
aside. 
BART 
Yikes! What the hell is that? 
LISA 


It's the centerpiece, Bart! 


TABLE DRAFT 5/15/90 PAGE 17. 


BART 
Well it's taking up valuable real 
estate. 
He elbows it harder. 
LISA 
Bart, stop it! 
BART 
Move it or lose it, man! 
LISA 
Mon! 
MARGE 
Now, just wait a minute! I'm sure 
there's room for both. 
Balancing the platter with one hand, Bart grabs the 
centerpiece and tries to move it. Lisa immediately grabs 
the other end and a tug-of-war ensues. 
LISA 
Baaart! You're wrecking it! LET GO! 
Without warning, he does, and the unthinkable happens: The 
centerpiece flies out of Lisa's hands and plops into the 
fireplace. 
LISA (CONT'D) 
(ANGUISHED SCREAM) 
Instantly, her masterpiece bursts into flames. 
GRAMPA 
(HAPPILY, RE: FIRE) Hey! That got ‘er 
goin'! 
BART 


Bitchin'! 


TABLE DRAFT 5/15/90 PAGE 18. 


Frantically, Lisa tries to fish it out with fireplace 
tongs, but the centerpiece crumbles into ashes. 


LISA 
(FURIOUS) BAAARRTT! 
Lisa lunges for Bart and they scuffle violently, knocking 
plates off the table and spilling stuff on the relatives, 
who REACT angrily. Homer and Marge finally pull the kids 
apart. Lisa breaks free and runs upstairs, SOBBING 
hysterically. 
HOMER 
Awright, Bart that's it! Go to your 
room NOW! 
BART 
Okay. I'1l take some white meat and 
stuffing to go... and, ah, send up the 
pumpkin pie in about twenty minutes. 
HOMER 
I said Now! 
BART 
Mom, do I have to? 
MARGE 
Yes you do! I hope you're happy, Bart! 
You've RUINED THANKSGIVING! 
The words hit Bart like lawn darts. 
FADE OUT. 


OF A e] 


TABLE DRAFT 5/15/90 PAGE 19. 


ACT TWO 


FADE IN: 
INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - BART'S BEDROOM - DAY 


Bart SLAMS his door, locks it, and barricades it with a 
bureau. 


BART , 

(FUMING) I didn't ruin Thanksgiving! 

She did... Buncha jerks... I always 

get blamed for everything... 
INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
There are two conspicuously empty chairs. Santa's Little 
Helper is sniffing and eyeing the turkey. Homer is saying 
grace. 

HOMER 

...And, Lord, we're especially thankful 

for nuclear power, the cleanest, safest 

energy source there is, except for 

solar, which is just a pipe dream. And 

we'd like to thank you for the peace 

and love our family experienced several 

times this year -- ‘cause, I mean... 

well, like tonight. You saw what 

happened. Oh, Lord, be honest. Are we 

the worst family in the universe, or 

what? 


Everyone GRUMBLES "Amen". 


TABLE DRAFT 5/15/90 PAGE 20. 


SELMA 
(TO PATTY) Worst prayer yet. 


O.S. we hear mournful SAXOPHONE music. Homer looks up at 
the ceiling and gives an annoyed GRUNT. 


MARGE 
Why don't I go talk to the children? 
She exits. 
HOMER 
Don't worry, Marge'1l fix everything. 
Homer starts eating halfheartedly. Everyone else digs in. 
PATTY 
Selma, your Swedish meatballs are 
delicious. 
SELMA 
And your trout is divine. 
INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - LISA'S BEDROOM 


Lisa is sadly PLAYING her sax, still SNIFFLING. Marge 
KNOCKS and enters. 


MARGE 
Honey, are you ready to come back 
downstairs? 

LISA 
I don't think so, Mom. 

MARGE 
Your food is getting cold. 

| LISA 


That's all right. 


ER Ee a OE ER RE 


TABLE DRAFT 5/15/90 PAGE 21. 


MARGE 
Lisa, I'm very sorry about what 
happened. 
LISA 
Mom, I poured my heart into the 
centerpiece! Things like that always 
happen in this family! 
MARGE 
I've noticed that, too. Well, when you 
feel like coming down, we'll be there. 
Marge exits. 
INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - BART'S BEDROOM 
Bart is gathering things to take on the road. He grabs a 
shirt, some shorts, socks and underwear and tries to stuff 
them in a little knapsack. It's too much, so he puts back 
the socks and then the underwear. 
"BART o 
This family was just a pit stop for me! 
All they were good for was gas, food 
and lodging! 
He scribbles a farewell note. 
BART (CONT'D) 
(WRITING) Dear Stupid Idiots... You 
have sent me to my room... for the last 
time... ever... in history. You will 
never... see me... (CROSSES IT OUT) lay 
eyes on me... again. Your enemy... 
Bart Simpson. 


There's a KNOCK at the door. 


TABLE DRAFT 5/15/90 PAGE 22. 


INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - HALLWAY - BY BART'B DOOR 
MARGE 
Bart, you can come down to dinner as 
soon as you're ready to apologize to 
your sister. And it's going to be a 
real apology in front of evrybody, and 
you have to mean it. 
INT. BART'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
BART 
Don't hold your breath, lady. 
He climbs out the window. 
EXT. SIMPSON HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 


Bart is crawling out the window. He jumps to the ground, 
smashing a small shrub. 


BART 
Uh-oh!... I mean, good! 
He jumps up and down on another shrub, destroying it. 
HOMER (0.S.) 
Bad dog! Bad dog! Drop that 
drumstick! Gimme that, that's people 
food. Bad dog! 
From around the corner, we HEAR the back door open. 
HOMER (0.S., CONT'D) 
Okay, you're going outside. 


The door CLOSES. A downbeat Santa's Little Helper joins 
Bart. 


TABLE DRAFT 5/15/90 PAGE 23. 


BART 
(PETTING DOG) Hey, boy! You're a good 
dog! You hate them, too, doncha? Come 
on, we don't need them to get a 
Thanksgiving dinner! 
EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY 


Bart and Santa's Little Helper set off, taking the kind of 
route only a kid would use: 


A. Cutting through the neighbor's hedges. 
B. Teetering along a garden wall over a goldfish pond. 
C. Crawling through a storm culvert. 
CLOSE ON - STREET SIGN 
It's the corner of Croesus Drive and Mammon Lane. PAN DOWN 
to Bart, who is standing in front of the stately Burns 
manor. 
BART 
Wow! Swan-ky! 
The Simpsons' MAILPERSON passes Bart on the sidewalk. 
MATLPERSON 
Excuse me... 


She stuffs a handful of mail in an ornate mailbox shaped 
like a castle. The door is a drawbridge. 


BART 
Hey, you mean rich people get mail on 
holidays?

INT. BURNS! MANOR - DINING ROOM - DAY 
We PAN down a sumptuous refectory table, loaded with enough 
food to feed thirty people, including a sixty pound turkey 
with one small slice removed. At the head of the table is 
the sole diner, MR. BURNS. On his plate is the small slice 
of turkey, minus a couple of bites. 
BURNS 
(CHEWING) Mmmm, delicious. Smithers, 
every year you outstrip yourself in 
succulence. 
SMITHERS 
Thank you, sir. Would you like some 
candied yams? 
BURNS 
Oh, no! I couldn't eat another bite. 
(GESTURING) Dispose of all this. I 
did, however, save room for your 
special pumpkin pie. 
SMITHERS

Bart is peering through the hedges, hungrily eyeing the pie 
on the windowsill. 


BART 
Mmmm. (TO DOG) Stay here, boy. 
Bart pushes through the bushes, looks around, then reaches 
for the pie. As his fingers cross the plane of the 
windowsill, we see it break a complicated red laser grid, 
setting off a loud KLAXON HORN and BELL.

Two SECURITY GUARDS, one reading "Les Miserables", look up 
from their pathetic card-table dinner and scramble to their

huge, Norad-like map of the grounds. One of the guards 
rushes to the window with binoculars.

At that moment Bart and Santa's Little Helper cross some 
railroad tracks, and there is an immediate, abrupt change: 
They're on the "wrong side of the tracks", in abject 
squalor, amid ramshackle houses, junk-strewn lots, etc. We

Bart and Santa's Little Helper finally hit bottom: A 
sleazy street with a check-cashing service, an "Occidental"

"Tuxedos by Henri", with a sign that reads "For Lease".

quickly swabs his arm, and picks up a large needle.

LISA 
Oh, Bart. I've been coming up here for 
years. See? (POINTS) That's my 
candle wax! 
BART 
Okay, I'm sorry. And, Lisa... 
(SINCERELY) I'm sorry I made your 
centerpiece burn up. 
LISA 
Sorry, Bart -- "sorry" doesn't do it. 
BART 
Okay, let's quit foolin' around. Cash 
settlement. (PULLS OUT BILLS) Twelve 
big ones. 
LISA 
(SCORNFULLY) I don't want your blood 
money! 
BART 
How'd you know? 
INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM/BATHROOM

MARGE 
(JUBILANT WHISPER) Homer! It's Bart! 
He's up on the roof! 
HOMER 
(ELATED) My boy! He's back!... (BEAT) 
I'm gonna kill him! 
MARGE 
Shhhh! He and Lisa are making up. And 
if they don't fall and kill themselves, 
we might have a family again. 
EXT. SIMPSON HOUSE - ROOF - NIGHT 
Lisa and Bart are tossing a wiffle ball back and forth. 
LISA 
The thing that really hurt was the 
laughter. Or I should say the sadistic 
glee. 
BART 
Lisa, how are you gonna grow up if you 
can't get used to people wrecking 
beautiful things? 
LISA 
Just answer one question. Why did you 
do it? Because you hate me, or because 


you're bad? 


TABLE DRAFT 5/15/90 PAGE 51. 


BART 
(EXASPERATED) I don't know! I don't 
know why I did it! I don't know why I 
enjoyed it! And I don't know why I'll 
do it again! 

LISA 
Okay. I'11 tell you what. Since you 
have yet to develop the first glimmer 
of a conscience at the age of ten, I 
think you should have an advisor... 

BART 
Like, whattaya mean? 

LISA 
Someone who could tell you when you're 
going too far... like Jiminy Cricket 
did for Pinocchio. 

BART 
(DRYLY) Yeah, well I don't happen to 
have a little cartoon character telling 
me right from wrong. 

LISA 
No, but you have me. 

Bart mulls it over. 

BART 

Well... Okay. 


Lisa gives him a KISS to seal the deal.

BART (CONT'D) 
Boy, you really take advantage of a 
situation. 
INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS 
HOMER 
(TO MARGE) You know, we're great 
parents! 
INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - KITCHEN - ALMOST MIDNIGHT 
The Simpsons, in their pajamas, are reunited at the 
breakfast table. There's a heaping platter of turkey 
sandwiches. The clock reads five minutes to midnight. 
Marge is hugging Bart. 
HOMER 
(PRAYING) O Lord, on this blessed day, 
we thank thee for giving our family one 
more crack at togetherness. Amen. 
Everyone starts NOISILY wolfing down their sandwiches. 
BART 
(SELLING) Hey everybody! Cranberry 
sauce! Right here! Help yourself! 
Marge takes a bottle over to Maggie. 
MARGE 
Ready, Maggie? One... two... three! 
In one smooth motion, Marge yanks the pacifier out of 
Maggie's mouth and replaces it with the bottle. Maggie 
doesn't miss a SUCK. 


HOMER 


(TO BART) Get me a beer, boy.

ON BART AND LISA 


Bart takes a beer from the refrigerator, starts to shake 
it, then stops. 


BART 
(SOTTO) Lisa. What about this? Funny 


or cruel? 


LISA 
Funny. 
BART” 
Y'sure? a 
LISA 
Yes. 


Bart shakes it vigorously. Lisa looks at the turkey. 
LISA (CONT'D) 
Hey, I call the wishbone! 
She pulls it out of the turkey carcass. 
BART 
I call other endsies! 
He grabs the other end. 
LISA 
If we both wish for the same thing, 
then it's sure to happen. l 
MARGE 
Why don't you both wish for a happy 
family? 
BART 
(RELUCTANTLY) Okay... I 


They pull and the wishbone SNAPS.

Oh, well.

SPLASH. The kids LAUGH.

BILL 
(LAUGHS FEEBLY, THEN:) Yeah, you’re 
dead weight, Marty. 
B. Homer strains to see through the snow as he follows a 
pair of taillights on a very bumpy road. He approaches a 
RINGING railroad crossing and follows the taillights 
through. He sees crossing gates on either side of hin,

HOMER’S POV - THROUGH WINDSHIELD 
Each pass of the wipers lets him see for only a second, 
then snow blankets the windshield. The first three wiper 
passes reveal only the snow-covered road. The fourth pass 
reveals a station wagon five feet in front of Homer. 
HOMER 
(SCREAMS) 


From outside, we see Homer’s car SMASH into the station 
wagon.

Now, before I give you the check, one: 
more question: Uh, this place "Moe’s"

this is a business of some kind? 
HOMER’S BRAIN (V.0.) 
Don’t tell him you were at a bar! 
(GASPS) But what else is open at 
night? 
HOMER 
(CONFIDENT) It’s a pornography store.

luxury sedan rolling in slow motion into a cement wall. A 
family of crash dummies is inside. 
GERMAN ENGINEER 
Our tireless safety engineers crash- 
test over one thousand cars a year. 
The car ROLLS into the wall and slowly FOLDS up like an 
accordion. Parts FLY everywhere. The steering column 
IMPALES the driver dummy. The front seat passenger flies 
through the windshield. A dummy crawls out of the car. 
LISA 
Hey, wait... that’s not a dummy! 
GERMAN ENGINEER 
(SUDDENLY STERN) This exhibit is 
Closed.

including the car from The Flintstones and a wienermobile. 


WIENER CAR OPERATOR 
For the last time, sir, this car is 
made of fiberglass and metal... no 
meat. 

HOMER 


(SADLY) Are you sure? 


10. 


9FO7 FINAL 5/29/92 


WIENER CAR OPERATOR 
(TAKING PITY) All right... maybe 
there’s a little meat in there 
somewhere. 

HOMER 
I knew it, I knew it!. 

He rejoins the kids. They pass... 

HOMER 

(GASP) The Batmobile! 


He runs his hands over the (TV) Batmobile reverently, then 
turns and sees a sign, "Meet Adam West." 


HOMER 
Adam West! Hey kids, Batman! 
Bart and Lisa give Homer a "You are so queer" look. 
LISA 
' Dad, that’s not the real Batman. 
Adam West puts his arms around Bart and Lisa. 
ADAM WEST . 
Of course I’m Batman! See? Here’s a 
picture of me with Robin. 
BART 
Who the hell is Robin? 
ADAM WEST 
Oh. I guess you’re only familiar 
with the new "Batman" movies. 


The camera moves in close as his intensity builds, then 
tilts diagonally a la the TV show. 


11. 


9FO7 FINAL 5/29/92 


ADAM WEST (CONT’D) 
Michelle Pfeiffer... ha! The only 
true "Catwoman" is Julie Newmar, Lee 
Merriwether or Eartha Kitt. And I 
didn’t need molded plastic to improve 
my physique. (TAPS CHEST) Pure 
West. And how come Batman doesn’t 
dance anymore? Remember the Batusi? 
Adam West starts to do the "Batusi," with accompanying 
GRUNTS. Homer’s expression changes from smile to frozen 
smile to frightened smile. He grabs the kids’ hands and 
leads them away. 
HOMER 
{SCARED LAUGH) Nice meeting you! (LOW 
TO KIDS) Just keep moving. Don’t 
make eye contact. 
He gets them a safe distance away, then stops in his 
tracks. At the Kumatsu Motors display, a big red pick-up 
truck with a snow plow attached revolves on a platform. 
HOMER (CONT’D) 
Wow! Just think what I could do with 
that truck. 
HOMER’S FANTASY 
Homer envisions himself standing with the plow in front of 
the White House. PRESIDENT BUSH stands next to him. In 
front of them are a line of PROTESTERS with signs reading 


“LET’S TRY COMMUNISM," "DESTROY ALL TREES," and "FORGET THE 
ALAMO."

PRESIDENT BUSH 
Homer, I’m supposed to have lunch 
with a wealthy influence peddler, but 
I can’t get out of my driveway 
because of those protesters. 

HOMER 
Mr. President, those young people are 
about to get a dose of reality. 


Homer drives his plow into the protesters shoving them out 
of the way. 


BACK TO 8CENE 
HOMER (CONT’D) 
(CHUCKLES) 
DEALER 
(WISEGUY VOICE) 20,000 smackers and 
she’s yours! 
Homer looks at the truck then shakes his head. 
HOMER 
I don’t know. I’m already in a lot 
of debt -- under several aliases: 
Homer Smith, Homer Schneider, Helen 
J. Watson... 
DEALER 
Pally, this doesn’t cost money, it 
makes money! You make the payments 


by plowing driveways on the side. 


9F07 FINAL 5/29/92 


HOMER 
Well... I really should discuss this 
with my wife. 

DEALER 


(TRYING TO SELL TRUCK) All right, but 
there’s another guy interested in it. 
HOMER 
(GASPS) There is?! I/’11 take it! 
Homer pulls out his check book. 
HOMER (CONT’D) 
Tell the other guy, "No hard 
feelings." 
DEALER 
What other guy? (COVERING) Oh, yeah.

EXT. SIMPSON HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - NIGHT 


The kids have gone to bed. Marge and Homer stand with the 
snow plow. The plow’s door is open. 


MARGE 
I can’t believe you bought that plow. 
We can’t afford it. 
HOMER 
Hey, if you’re going to get mad at me 
every time I do something stupid, 
then I guess I’11 just have to stop 
doing stupid things. 
MARGE 
Good. 
HOMER 
Fine. I/11 never ever do another 
stupid thing. Good night! 
Homer walks into the open door of the plow and SMASHES his 
face, hard. A big lump raises on his head. Homer doesn’t 
say anything. 
MARGE 
Oh, Homer, didn’t that hurt? 
HOMER 


(SMALL VOICE, OBVIOUSLY IN PAIN) No. 


15. 


9¥07 FINAL 5/29/92 


EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY 
Homer goes from car to car, putting leaflets on 
windshields. The picture shows a cute snowman with his 
family running in terror from Homer in his plow. Beneath, 
it says "MR. PLOW ~- CALL KL5-3226." Homer finishes the 
last car; a WIND comes up and blows them all away. Homer 
MOANS and starts to pick them up. 
BARNEY (0.S.) 
Forget it, Homer! 


Homer turns and sees BARNEY dressed in a giant diaper in 
front of "Lullabuy$", a baby store. 


BARNEY 
People don’t read these things. 
Watch. 
He tries to hand out leaflets to PASSERSBY. They take them 
and immediately throw them out, shrink in fear, or cross 
the street to avoid him. 
BARNEY (CONT’D) 
Twenty percent off at Lullabuys. 
| Just tell ro "Big Baby" sent you. I 
know you can hear me! I’m talking to 
you! 
"JUST STAMP THE TICKET" MAN 
You sicken me. 
He walks past. 
BARNEY 
(TO HOMER) I guess guys like us just 
can’t get a break. Well, at least I 
can’t sink any lower. 


Barney’s diaper blows off and he runs after it.

HOMER 
(CLEARS THROAT) Dear Lord, in your 
infinite wisdom, you know the number 
to call when you need a plow is 
KLONDIKE 5+3226. 
REV. LOVEJOY 
Homer, this is really low.

PLAYING a really fast version of "Amazing Grace" as two 
MUSCULAR USHERS hustle Homer off. 
INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - KITCHEN ~ DAY 


We see a lot of snow has fallen outside. Homer stares at 
the phone.

MARGE 
No, Homer. 
HOMER

Lisa enters. 
LISA 
Have you considered buying cheap 
commercial time on channel ninety- 
two? 
HOMER 
Channel ninety-two? Oh, I saw that 
once when I sat on the remote. 
LISA 
You really should consider it. You 
can sell anything. 
Lisa turns on the TV. 
ON TV 


We see the old SEA CAPTAIN on a home shopping-type 
network. 


SEA CAPTAIN 
Arr! I’ve scoured the seven seas to 
find the perfect stockin’ stuffer: 
shrunken heads from New Guinea. 
He holds up several shrunken heads.

do about it? Nuthin, that’s what. 
(MANIACAL LAUGH) 
He kicks snow onto the intimidated family. 
HOMER (0.S.) 
Stop! 


Homer bounds on screen. His jacket has "MR. PLOW" written 
on back. 


MARGE/LISA/BART 
Mr. Plow! 
HOMER 
Get out of here, you lousy... season! 


He GRUNTS with exertion as he hustles Grampa away by the 
collar and sends him off with a kick in the butt. 


GRAMPA 
All right... I’m going... (PULLS OFF 
WIG) (SAD) My head hurts. I have to 
lie down for a while. 

The family CHEERS. 

HOMER 
Hello, I’m Mr. Plow. Are you tired

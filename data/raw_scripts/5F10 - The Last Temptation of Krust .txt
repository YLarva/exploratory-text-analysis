ACT ONE 
FADE IN: 
EXT. SPRINGFIELD MALL - DAY - ESTABLISHING SCENE 1 
INT. SPRINGFIELD MALL - CONTINUOUS 
The SIMPSONS are shopping. They stop in front of a shoe 
store called, "Goody New Shoes." The sign has a picture of 
a wimpy Buster Brown type and his even wimpier dog. 
MARGE 
Qoo, look! This is a perfect chance to 
get you kids some nice church shoes. 
BART/LISA 
(GROAN) 
BART 
What do we need church shoes for? 
Jesus wore sandals. 
HOMER 
Well, maybe if he had better arch 


support, they wouldn’t have caught him. 


Marge winces, then points to an exotic BIRD in a cage 
outside a pet store. 


MARGE 
(GETTING RID OF HIM) Oh look, Homer. 
There’s that bird you like to argue 


with. 


5F10 RECORD 6/23/97 


HOMER, SCENE 1 (CONT’D) 
Well, well, well... If it isn’t 
Professor Know-it-all. 
Homer swaggers over to the bird. 
INT. SHOE STORE - A FEW MINUTES LATER 
Bart and Lisa are seated glumly with their shoes off. The 
SALES CLERK, a middle-aged, tired-looking man, is measuring 
their feet. 
MARGE 
They need a good, stiff, all-purpose 
dress shoe. Something for church, but 
also for doctors appointments, (OVER 
KIDS’ GLAZED EXPRESSIONS) dental 
check-ups, piano recitals, building 
dedications, visiting elderly 
relatives, altar boy classes, 
haircuts... 
CLERK 
Well, we have a brown shoe. 
MARGE 
(INTRIGUED SOUND) I’ve seen that color 
on the President. 
LISA 
("DISAPPOINTED") Talk about bad luck! 
I forgot to wear socks today. Guess I 
can’t try those on. Rats! 


Lisa smiles smugly at Bart.

CLERK SCENE 1 (CONT’D) 
No problem, you can wear the "Store 
Sock." 


He pulls an old, disgusting sock off a hook with a pair of 
tongs and offers it to Lisa. 


BART 
What a break, huh, Lis? 
Lisa grimaces and gingerly takes the sock from the tongs. 
CUT TO: 
INT. SHOE STORE - A FEW MINUTES LATER 
The clerk finishes slipping shoes on Bart’s feet. 
CLERK 
(SMALL PAINED NOISE) Would you mind 
lacing them up, kid? I have a bad 
back. 
BART 
Hey, if you didn’t wanna tie shoes, you 
shouldn't have become a shoe salesman. 
Bart waggles the shoe impatiently. The clerk SIGHS and 
bends over to tie the shoe. His back makes a QUIET 
CRACKING sound. 
From across the mall we hear: 
HOMER (0.S.) 
That’s where you're wrong, pal! 


Marge looks over to see Homer arguing with a colorful 
parrot. 


5F10 RECORD 6/23/97 Page 4. 


HOMER SCENE 1 (CONT'D) 
(POINTING FOR EMPHASIS) It’s not 
enough to want a cracker. You have to 
earn it! 
The bird stares at him blankly. 
BACK TO SCENE 


Bart and Lisa are now CLOMPING around in shoes that are 
obviously too large. 


LISA 
Mom, these are at least two sizes too 
big. 
MARGE 
Perfect. You'll grow into them. 
BART 
When? 
MARGE 
You’re both way overdue for a spurt. 
INT. SPRINGFIELD MALL - A FEW MINUTES LATER SCENE 2 
The family is heading for the car. They pass some people 
lined up at a promotional booth. A sign reads, "Laugh ‘Til 
You Care." A VOLUNTEER approaches Marge. 
VOLUNTEER 
Excuse me, ma’am. Do you like to 


laugh? 


5F10 RECORD 6/23/97 


MARGE SCENE 2 (CONT'D) 
Oh, yes! (ADDING) As long as it’s 
tasteful... And never at someone, or 
with... And not where it would be 
distracting, like the cockpit of a jet 
where the pilot is trying to 
concentrate on... 

The volunteer quickly swings to Homer. 

VOLUNTEER 
Excuse me, sir? Do you like to laugh? 

HOMER 
Why, yes. Yes I do. 

VOLUNTEER 
Then you'll love our comedy festival. 
It’s for a good cause. 

HOMER 
A rest home for pirates? 

LISA 
(READING PAMPHLET) No, Dad, it’s to 
fight soil erosion. 

HOMER 
(COMMITTED) Now that’s a fight I want 
to be a part of. 


Bart is looking at a sign on the booth which lists the 
performers’ names, including Jerry Seinfeld.

BART SCENE 2 (CONT’D) 
Hey, somebody screwed up! It says all 
the top comics are going to be there, 
but there’s no Krusty. 

VOLUNTEER 
Who? 

BART 
Krusty the Clown! 

The volunteer stares blankly. 

BART (CONT’D) 
The funniest man alive? The Prince of 
Pies? The Sultan of Seltzer? 


After an awkward beat, the volunteer turns to DR. HIBBERT 
who is passing by. 


VOLUNTEER 
Excuse me, sir? Do you like to laugh? 
DR. HIBBERT 
Only if something tickles me just 
right. (LONG HIBBERT CHUCKLE) . 
EXT. SPRINGFIELD AMPHITHEATER - ESTABLISHING 
A banner reads "Comedy Festival Tonight." Burly WORKERS 
crowd around a door marked "Crew Entrance." They’re 
LAUGHING and SLAPPING each other on the back. We PAN OVER 
to a door marked "Comics Entrance," where a group of sour- 
looking COMEDIANS congregate. 
COMIC #1 
Life sucks. 


COMIC #2 


Hey, that’s my bit.

SCENE 2 (CONT’D) 
INT. AMPHITHEATER - BACKSTAGE - CONTINUOUS 


Bart approaches JERRY SEINFELD, who is on the phone, 
holding a sheaf of papers. 


JERRY 
(INTO PHONE) Of course we want you to 
perform. But this is a family event. 
If you could just tone down the cursing 
and the raunch... Aw, you’re the best. 
Jerry hangs up and calls out to his assistant. 
JERRY (CONT'D) 
We got Bob Newhart. 
Bart walks up to Jerry. 
BART 
Excuse me, I'm looking for someone 
named (LOOKS AT SLIP OF PAPER) Jerry 
Seinfeld. 
JERRY 
Somebody want to get this kid a TV? 
BART 
Gee thanks, mister. 
JERRY 
Look, kid. I’m Jerry Seinfeld. 
BART 
(DISAPPOINTED) Oh. Well, if you’re 
running this show, how could you leave 


out Krusty the Clown? 


5F10 RECORD 6/23/97 Page 8. 


JERRY SCENE 2 (CONT’D) 
(FONDLY) Ah, Krusty the Clown. That 
takes me back. (THEN) Didn’t he die 
in a grease fire? 
BART 
No, he’s alive. And he’s so funny you 
could plotz. At least according to his 
press release. 
Bart hands Jerry Krusty’s press release, which reads: 
"Local Clown Available for Hire." Along the bottom are 
tear-off tabs with Krusty’s phone number. 
JERRY 
(PICKING UP PHONE) Well, if he’s half 
as alive as you say he is, he’s in. 
INT. KRUSTY’S OFFICE - A LITTLE LATER SCENE 3 
KRUSTY’S head is sticking out of an old fashioned steam 
cabinet. SIDESHOW MEL is holding the phone up to his 
sweaty ear. 
KRUSTY 
(INTO PHONE) Charity, eh? What’s my 
cut?... Nothing?! I make more than 
that taking a shvitz. 
We PULL BACK to see a group of children sitting on the 
floor around Krusty. Sideshow Mel puts a balloon up to 
Krusty’s mouth, which he BLOWS up. Mel quickly ties it 
into a dachshund and hands it to a CHILD in a party hat. 
KRUSTY (CONT’D) 
(PERFUNCTORY) Hey hey, happy birthday. 
(TO MEL) Now get ‘em outta here. 
INT. AMPHITHEATER - BACKSTAGE - CONTINUOUS 


Jerry turns to Bart. 


5F10 RECORD 6/23/97 Page 


JERRY SCENE 3 (CONT’D) 
He seems reluctant. 
BART 
Tell him it’11 count towards his 
community service. 
BACK TO KRUSTY 
KRUSTY 
(RELUCTANT) All right, I’1l do it. 
(HANGS UP, GROANS) You disable one 
airplane smoke detector, and your whole 
Saturday night is shot. 
INT. AMPHITHEATER - THAT NIGHT 
The Simpsons and many TOWN REGULARS sit at candlelit tables 
facing a painted brick wall set. A ZONED-OUT COMIC is on- 
stage. 
ZONED-OUT COMIC 
I finally got around to reading the 
dictionary. Turns out the zebra did 
te 
The audience LAUGHS. Homer stares ahead blankly. 
HOMER 
I don’t get it. 
LISA 
Dad, the zebra didn’t do it. It’s just 
a word at the end of the dictionary. 
HOMER 


I still don’t get it. 


5F10 RECORD 6/23/97 


LISA SCENE 3 (CONT’D) 
(EXASPERATED) It’s just a joke. 
HOMER 
It's a joke? Oh I get it. (NOT 
GETTING IT) I get jokes. (LAUGHS) 
INT. AMPHITHEATER - BACKSTAGE - CONTINUOUS 


Krusty arrives with his entourage: Sideshow Mel and MR. 
TEENY. He approaches a group of HIP COMICS, including 
Jerry. 


JERRY 
Hey, everybody! Krusty’s here. You 
know everybody, don’t you? 


Krusty looks blankly at the hip comics. A DEF COMEDY JAM 
COMIC shakes Krusty’s hand. 


DEF COMEDY JAM COMIC 
(EXCITED) Yo, Krusty. You da bomb! 

KRUSTY 
(COVERING) Heyyy, it’s you. (VAGUELY) 
And this guy -- with all the jokes he 
does... 

HIGH-STRUNG COMIC

into comedy. 

KRUSTY 
Yeah, thanks. And I love your shtick 
with the thing there... just great.

stage. 


JERRY (CONT’D) 
Our next performer has been called 
comedy’s kitten with a whip... 
BART 
(EAGERLY) Oh boy, Krusty!

BART 
What the?! 
PHOEBE KARP walks on stage and takes the mic. 
PHOEBE

Marge does a SPIT-TAKE. 
MARGE 
Oh good Lord. 
PHOEBE 
So I got that going for me. Plus, I've

JERRY 
Why is it that in a comic strip all the 
characters only have four fingers? Is 
it that hard to draw another finger? 
LAUGHS and APPLAUDS. 

HOMER 
(MOUTH OUT OF SYNC) Lazy cartoonists. 

JERRY 
Anyway, it’s time for something 
special, the man Spencer Tracy called 
the most promising newcomer of 1959, 
please put your hands together for 


Krusty the Clown! 


A cocky Krusty takes the stage. 


Only Bart 


KRUSTY 
So how ‘bout those TV dinners? I try 
one the other day. Lightning strikes --

We hear some mic FEEDBACK. PRINCIPAL SKINNER COUGHS. 
ANGLE ON COMICS BACKSTAGE 
PHOEBE

Swansons. 
The other comics SNICKER derisively.

Didn’t like that last one, huh? 
Krusty slips in some fake buck teeth and starts bowing.

dickey?

hey! 


Krusty pulls a string hanging from his lapel and his dickey 
rolls up, FLAPPING. The crowd stares ahead silently. 


KRUSTY 
Ahh soo. Ahhh soo. Me lika da flied 
lice... Me flappa dickey long time.. 
Krusty desperately FLAPS his dickey. 
INT. AMPHITHEATER - BACKSTAGE - MOMENTS LATER 
Bart walks backstage past a number of make-shift dressing 
rooms separated by scrims. He finds Krusty slumped in a 
chair sadly FLAPPING his dickey. 
BART 
Hey Krusty, great set. 
KRUSTY 
Are you kidding? I stunk up the joint. 
BART 
No, I was talking to Lisa back there, 
and we both agreed you killed. 
KRUSTY 
(BRIGHTENING) Really? Lisa, huh? 
BART 
Oh sure, there were a lot of laughs. 
You probably couldn’t hear them, the 


acoustics were so bad.

KRUSTY SCENE 4 (CONT'D) 
Yeah, the acoustics, that’s what it 
was. 
BART 
Plus, they weren’t warmed up enough. 
Either that or they were all laughed 
out.

Yeah, yeah. All those things. I mean, 
"Me so solllly"...

Yeah, I was great.

see Krusty’s and Bart’s silhouettes. Krusty visibly 
slumps. The STAGE MANAGER approaches. 
STAGE MANAGER (0.S.)

Krusty snatches a paper and opens it up. 

KRUSTY (CONT’D)

SIDESHOW MEL 
Well, they say any publicity is good 
publicity...

A sympathetic Mr. Teeny offers him a banana. Krusty knocks 
it away.

KRUSTY 
Well, I'll fix that. (GETTING UP) I’m 
going on the bender to end all benders! 
Krusty heads for the door, flicking his cigarette toward 
the camera. It sails into the camera lens and SPRAYS a 
shower of SPARKS.

Let’s poke him a while little longer. 
Bart comes over. 
BART 
Get away from him, you little freaks!

Bart recoils from Krusty’s breath. 
BART 
Pew! What were you drinking, gasoline? 
KRUSTY 
("IF YOU MUST KNOW") Yes, I was 
drinking gasoline, Mother... I just 
don’t remember hitting my head 16 
times. 
Krusty staggers to his feet and looks into a poster of 
himself, thinking it’s a mirror. He starts combing his 
hair, checking his tongue, etc. 
BART 
Uh, Krusty... 
KRUSTY 
Hang on kid, I got a tack in my head. 
He tries to pull out the tack he sees in the poster. 
BART 
That’s one of your posters. (PROUDLY) 
I have all the Krusty stuff. 
Krusty looks around the room at all the merchandise he’s 


endorsed: sheets, a lamp, a phone, a clock, and "Krusty’s

Bart each shampoo one side of his hair. 


KRUSTY 
No question, I gotta freshen up my act. 
Jerry, you're a professional comedian, 
right? (UNSURE) Right? Answer me. 

JERRY 
Yes! Now stop squirming. I’m trying 
to get these tangles out. 

BART 
(SLIGHTLY FEY) They’re just 
impossible. 

Krusty and Jerry eye Bart suspiciously. 

BART (CONT’D) 
(DEFENSIVE) Well, they are! (CHANGING 
SUBJECT) Anyway, don’t you have some 
advice for Krusty? 

JERRY 
Well, these days people like 
observational humor, about things they 
deal with in everyday life. 

KRUSTY 
Oh, you mean like when your lazy butler 
washes your sock garters and they’re 


still covered with shmutz?

Homer, Marge, and Lisa, are seated on the couch. Bart 
stands in front of them on a small crate. Over his head is

Thank you. Thank you. And now, the

Clown... 


The family politely APPLAUDS. Krusty casually walks out to 
the center of the living room with a notebook. 


KRUSTY 
(STIFF) Hello. I’m a real person and 
as a real person I’ve made some 
humorous observations about real life. 
For example, have you ever noticed how 
there are two phone books? A white one 
and a yellow one? What’s the deal with 
that?

next? Blue pages? 
MARGE 
They have those. They’re government 
listings. 
KRUSTY 
I see. 


Krusty FLIPS through his notebook, flustered, as the 
Simpsons stare at him. 


KRUSTY 
Uhh... what about... 2 cent 
stamps?... pizza pie’s very hot these 
days... can't open pickle jars... no 
mail on Sunday... out of paper

A microphone-covered podium stands in front of the curtain

a grim-faced Krusty walk to the podium as cameras FLASH 
away. 


KRUSTY 
Thank you all for coming. (CLEARS

REPORTER #2 
(CONCERNED) But, Krusty. Why now? 

Why not twenty years ago? 

KRUSTY 
‘Cause comedy ain’t funny anymore. 
Instead of time-tested jokes about

The reporters are still LAUGHING. Krusty grabs a handful 
of microphones, and steps away from the podium, "working

KRUSTY 
Then you got these "lady" comics

Krusty reaches into his pocket and pulls out a dollar bill.

INT. SIMPSON CAR - A LITTLE LATER SCENE 10 
The Simpsons are driving home.

exchange a discreet "thumbs up." 


INT. COFFEE HOUSE - A FEW DAYS LATER 


It’s a contemporary hang-out with couches, paintings, 
students with laptops, chess players, and JAZZ MUSIC. 
Krusty is holding court with the young comedians. 


KRUSTY 


Anyway, I’m doin’ last night’s show,

says "No Shirt, No Shoes, No Service."

take off their shirts and shoes, 


dare the owner to kick us out.

everybody to put their shirts on their 
heads, stuff their shoes down their 
pants, and march right back in. 
JERRY 
(IMPRESSED) Legally, he didn’t have a 
leg to stand on. 
KRUSTY 
(PROUD) Not a one. 
PHOEBE 
You are so fearless. You're like a dog 
in an aquarium, tearing everything up. 
ZONED-OUT COMIC 
Exactly. Aquarium dog. 
JERRY 
I’m proud of you, Krusty. Sure, I’ve 
got material success. Lots of it. But 
you're out there on the edge, doing it 
for the sheer thrill. If I wasn’t so 
afraid of clowns, I’d give you a big 
hug. 
The two businessmen who were at Krusty’s show approach. 
BUSINESSMAN #1 
Excuse me, Krusty. We've been watching 


you at Moe's all week.

BUSINESSMAN #1

dirty filthy liar. 
KRUSTY 
Get to the point, Armani. 
BUSINESSMAN #2 
Well, we think you'd be the perfect 
spokesman for our company’s new sports 
utility vehicle, the Canyonero. 
Krusty leaps to his feet and grabs the executives’ lapels. 
KRUSTY 
I guess you Wall Street weasels didn’t 
get the word. Krusty’s not for sale. 
BUSINESSMAN #1 
But you endorse everything! In fact, 
this endorsement contract comes from 
your line of legal forms. 
We see a tablet labeled, "Krusty’s Legal Forms." There’s a 
picture of Krusty dressed as a judge with a word balloon 
that says, "Hey, hey, they're binding!" 
KRUSTY 
(QUIETLY) It’s a quality form. (BIG) 
But those days are behind me. I don’t 


shill for nobody no more.

They point out the window to a gleaming sports utility 
vehicle. Krusty’s hair SPROINGS out of the ponytail back 
to its normal position. 
KRUSTY 
(COUGHS, TEMPTED NOISES, THEN) No! 


Krusty pulls his hair back into the ponytail and hustles 
the two businessmen toward the door. 


KRUSTY (CONT’D) 
Now take your corporate bloodwagon and

He shoves them out. They BUMP into a table, knocking

Krusty takes the stage to CHEERS and APPLAUSE. 
LENNY 
(TO HOMER) I brought a bag of money in 
case he wants us to burn it again. 
HOMER 
I hope he tells us to burn our pants. 
These things are driving me nuts! 


Krusty takes a long drag off his cigarette.

KRUSTY SCENE 11 (CONT'D) 
So this afternoon, two suits and four 
shoes came up to me and asked me to

Yeah! / Go Krusty! / Ass! 

KRUSTY 
Then they followed me home, begging me 
to take a test drive. And let me tell 
you, talk about roomy! That Canyonero 
combines the smooth handling of a 
European sports car with the rugged 
driveability of a sturdy 4X4.

KRUSTY 
Yeah, but that was before I got to know

Canyonero is the Cadillac of 
automobiles. 
The two businessmen flash Krusty an "OK" sign. There is an 
interested BUZZ from the crowd as Bart calls to Krusty in a 
stage whisper. 
BART 
Krusty, doesn’t this go against 
everything you've been saying? 
Krusty covers the mic with his hand and leans down to Bart. 
KRUSTY 
More or less. But in the end, you have 
to live with yourself. And I couldn’t 
live with myself if I'd let that 
Canyonero slip through my fingers. 
Krusty steps back to the mic.

car?

Canyonero dealership and take a test 
drive in an incredible new Canyonero. 
That‘s Canyonero. 
HOMER 
Canyonero, eh? 
Lenny jumps up. 
LENNY 
I’m going to get me one right now!

The crowd RATTLES the chain-link fence around the closed 
car lot. 


CROWD

The crowd quickly scales the chain-link fence and swarms 
the car lot. We see Moe straining to pry the door off a 
metal box, revealing rows of car keys hung on hooks.

Out of my way, Skinner! Or I’1l ram

Skinner drives out of the way. Homer RAMS him anyway. The 
jeeps continue SWERVING and CRASHING. The two businessmen 
look on in horror. Krusty ZIPS up in his complimentary 
Canyonero and LOWERS the power window.

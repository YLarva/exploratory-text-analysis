"WHO SHOT MR. BURNS? (PART TWO)" 
by 
Bill Oakley & Josh Weinstein 
ACT ONE 
FADE IN: SCENE 1 
CLOSE-UP = EMPTY LIQUOR BOTTLE 
The label reads "Vagrant’s Choice Fortified Scotch -- May 
Cause Ejection Of Stomach Contents." SLOW SPINNING PULL- 
OUT to reveal we are... 
INT. SMITHERS’ APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM ~- DAY 
The apartment is strewn with liquor bottles, half-eaten 
food, etc. -- the results of a prolonged binge. A 
dishevelled, unshaven SMITHERS lies passed out on the sofa, 
holding the Scotch. It slips from his hand and SHATTERS. 
He wakes up. 
SMITHERS 
(COTTON-MOUTH) Ugh. My mouth tastes 
like an ashtray. (DISGUSTED NOISES) 
He opens his mouth and several cigarette butts and matches 
fall out. From offscreen, he hears a SHOWER RUNNING and 
groggily gets up to investigate. 
INT. SMITHERS’ APARTMENT - BATHROOM - A SECOND LATER 


He enters the steamy bathroom. A shadowy figure showers 
behind the fogged-up glass door. 


SMITHERS 
Who’s in my shower? (SNIFFS) And 
who’s using my Paul Mitchell Curl 
Reviver? 
Smithers opens the shower door. Inside, a robust MR. BURNS 
SCRUBS himself. He turns to Smithers with a big smile, a 


la Bobby Ewing in the infamous 1986 season premiere of 
"Dallas." 


2F20 FINAL 1 10/21/94 Page 2. 


BURNS 
Smithers, wait your turn. There’s 
plenty of hot water for all. 

SMITHERS 
(STUNNED) Sir, you weren’t shot? 
(DEEP SIGH OF RELIEF) It was alla 
dream. Thank God. Everything’s back 
to normal. 

BURNS 
That’s right. The year is 1965, and 
you and I are undercover detectives on 
the hot-rod circuit. (BEAT) Now let’s 
burn rubber, baby! 


Burns puts on a racing helmet with a number on it. SMASH 
cuT TO: 


WASHED-OUT FOOTAGE of exciting auto racing action. MOD COP 
SHOW MUSIC plays over the opening credits. 


ANNOUNCER (V.O.) 
"Speedway Squad!" In color. 
A bunch of race cars SPEED by, pursued by Burns and 
Smithers in a dragster. Burns leans out the window, FIRING 
a shotgun. FREEZE FRAME. 
INT. SMITHERS’ APARTMENT - REALITY 
CLOSE-UP on Smithers as he jolts awake. 
SMITHERS 
Wait, that was all a dream. 
(BRIGHTENING) Hey, then maybe I 
haven’t become a hideous, drunken 


wreck! (LOOKS AROUND) 


2F20 FINAL 1 10/21/94 Page 3. 


Both Smithers and the apartment are in even more squalid 
shape than in the dream. 


SMITHERS (CONT’D) 
Oh. (BELCH) 
ON TV - DAY - (SHADOWY) 


KENT BROCKMAN stands outside the Town Hall, where police 
study the crime scene. 


KENT BROCKMAN 
Dozens of people are gunned down each 
day in Springfield, but until now, none 
of them was important. I’m Kent 
Brockman. At 3 p.m. Friday, local 
autocrat C. Montgomery Burns was shot 
following a tense confrontation at Town 
Hall. 

Footage of Mr. Burns being loaded into an ambulance, etc. 

KENT BROCKMAN (CONT’D) 
Burns was rushed to a nearby hospital, 
where he was pronounced dead. He was 
then transferred to a better hospital, 
where doctors upgraded his condition to 
"alive." 


Footage of a comatose Burns lying in bed hooked up to a 
life support system. 


BACK TO BROCKMAN. 
KENT BROCKMAN (CONT’D) 
Now, let’s talk to Police Chief Wiggum. 


He walks over to CHIEF WIGGUM, who is eating a Nutty Buddy. 


2F20 FINAL 1 10/21/94 


WIGGUM 
Hiya, Kent. Ah, right now, our K-9 
team is combing the crime scene. 
Police DOGS SNIFF around the Town Hall. Several converge 
on Kent Brockman, sniffing his jacket. They begin to 
WHINE, BARK, and paw at the pocket. Brockman takes out a 
baggie of medicinal herbs and quickly crams it in his 
mouth. 
KENT BROCKMAN 
(MOUTH FULL) Anything else, Chief? 
WIGGUM 
We’re, ah, also questioning two 
witnesses who were in the vicinity at 
the time. 
INT. POLICE STATION - INTERROGATION ROOM - LATER 


Under a bright light, EDDIE and LOU are grilling the two 
witnesses. Lou holds up a photo of Smithers. 


LOU 
Didja see this guy? Was he anywhere 
near the parking lot when Burns got 
shot? 
The cops walk aside to reveal the witnesses: MAGGIE and 
SANTA’S LITTLE HELPER (who’s still wearing his devices.) 
MARGE stands in the corner, frowning. 
MAGGIE 
(TWO SUCKS) 
The dog examines the photo and drools on it. 
EDDIE 
Aw, it’s no use. They ain’t talkin’. 
INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - DINING ROOM 


Marge is serving dinner.

LISA 
Everyone in Springfield had a reason to 
shoot Mr. Burns. Even us. 


The family members look AWKWARDLY away as she addresses 
them. 


LISA (CONT’D) 
Bart, he broke your dog’s legs. 
Grampa, he destroyed your home. And 
Dad, well, you went kind of berserk 
when he couldn’t remember your name. 

HOMER 
(SUDDENLY CRAZED) Berserk is right!! 
(SUDDENLY CALM) May I have some iced 
tea, please? 

BART 
Aren’t we forgetting someone, Sister 
Suspect? 

LISA 
(NERVOUS CHUCKLE) Yeah, I was just 
getting to me. Because of Mr. Burns, 
they cancelled my jazz program, and my 
friend Tito Puente got fired. But I 
could never shoot someone. 

BART 
Could so! 

LISA 


Could not! 


A beat as 


2F20 FINAL 1 10/21/94 


BART 
Could so! 

LISA 
Could not! 

BART 
Could so! 

LISA 
Could not! 

BART 
Could s-- 

HOMER 


Kids! Kids! Kids! As far as Daddy’s 
concerned, you’re both potential 
murderers. 

MARGE 
The police already have a suspect. 
It’s Mr. Smithers. 
everyone considers this. 

HOMER & BART 
(TOO EAGER) Sure, Smithers! / He’s a 
good suspect! / I bet he’s the one! / 
Definitely Smithers! (ETC.) 

GRAMPA 
(OVEREAGER, FAST) Yeah! Smingers did 
it! Case closed. Now, where’s my hat? 


I’m going to the outhouse. 


GRAMPA grabs his fedora and hurries out the door. 


Page 6. 


2F20 FINAL 1 10/21/94 


LISA 
We don’t have an outhouse. 
HOMER 
(ALARMED GASP) My tool shed! Oh Dad! 
Dad! 
Homer dashes after Grampa. 
EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET - A FEW DAYS LATER 
A desperate-looking Smithers slinks along, past PEOPLE’S 
suspicious glares. A patrol car drives slowly by and he 
SHUDDERS. 
SMITHERS 
Could I have shot Mr. Burns in a 
drunken rage? No. No, not me. I know 
in my heart I... 


Smithers puts his hand to his heart and feels something. 
He reaches into his coat and pulls out a revolver. 


SMITHERS’ BRAIN (V.O.) (CONT’D) 
(GASPS) My gun! (SNIFFS IT) And it’s 
been recently fired! Wait, I remember 
leaving the town meeting... 
SMITHERS’ FLASHBACK 
Through Smithers’ drunken P.O.V., everything is a blurry 
swirl of colors. MUSIC builds as a hazy, hunched-over 
figure comes into frame. 
SMITHERS (V.0.) 
I must’ve run into Mr. Burns outside, 
and... 
SMITHERS 
(ANGRY DRUNKEN MURMURING, THEN:) 


(STRUGGLING SOUNDS) 


Page 7. 


2F20 FINAL 1 10/21/94 Page 


Smithers FIRES his gun. 
BACK TO STREET 
SMITHERS 
Mr. Burns! What kind of a monster am 
rz! 


WIDEN TO REVEAL he is walking past a booth that reads, 
"Guess Your Monster Type -- Three Dollars." 


MONSTER GUESSER 
(HUFFY) Uh... There’s a little matter 
of money. 
EXT. SIMPSON HOUSE - SHADOWY DAY 
Homer stands in the yard, spraying a hose into his tool 
shed. BARNEY and MOE drive up, hanging off the back of a 
tow truck. Several pick-up trucks, etc., full of 
TOWNSPEOPLE pull up behind them. 
MOE 
Hey, Homer, us hotheads is gonna go 
tear down Burns’ machine and get our 
old Sun back. You wanna come with? 
HOMER 
Sure! I’ve had it up to here with 


these damn rickets! 


WIDEN to see Homer has severely bowed legs. He waddles 
over to Moe. 


EXT. MT. SPRINGFIELD - SUN BLOCKER - A LITTLE LATER 
Townspeople have attached chains and cables from their 


trucks (Willie on his tractor, Otto in his school bus, and 
Bumblebee Man in the KMEX van) to the base of the tower. 


2F20 FINAL 1 10/21/94 Page 


WILLIE 
(TO TRACTOR) Pull, Duchess, pull! 
(SOTTO) Do this for me, and ye can 
sleep in the house tonight. 
With a loud GROANING of metal, the tower begins to give 
way. Finally, the gigantic paddle TIPS OVER and rolls down 
the mountain. The men peer over the side. 
KRUSTY 
Um... Uh, what town did we just crush? 
SKINNER 
Shelbyville. 
TOWNSPEOPLE 
(BEAT, THEN:) Yay!! 
EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET - LATER 
SMITHERS 
Oh, this guilt is driving me mad. I’ve 
got to tell someone. 
WIDEN to see he’s entering a large church, on which is 
chiselled "CATHEDRAL OF THE DOWNTOWN." A letterboard reads 
"Archbishop Carries Less Than $20." 


INT. CATHEDRAL - CONTINUOUS 


Organ music echoes throughout the empty nave. Smithers 
steps into a confessional. 


2F20 FINAL 1 10/21/94 Page 10. 


INT. CATHEDRAL - CONFESSIONAL - CONTINUOUS 
SMITHERS 
Father, I’m not a Catholic, but... 
well, I tried to march in the St. 
Patrick’s Day parade... Anyway, I’ve 
got a rather large sin to confess. 
(DEEP BREATH) I’m the one who, who 
shot Mr. Burns. 
The little screen slides open to reveal Chief Wiggum 
sitting on the other side. He points a gun at Smithers and 
cocks it. 
WIGGUM 
That’s all I needed to hear. (LOOKS 
AROUND) Boy, this thing works great. 
Gotta get one down at the station. Heh 
heh. 
INT. POLICE STATION - INTERROGATION ROOM - A LITTLE LATER 


Wiggum, Eddie, and Lou are giving Smithers the third 
degree. 


SMITHERS 
The man became consumed by greed. He’d 
steal from anyone. 
FLASHBACK FROM PART ONE - BURNS’S OFFICE 
Burns looks through binoculars at the school’s oil derrick. 
SMITHERS 
This isn’t a rival company you’re 
battling with. It’s a school. People 


won’t stand for it. 


2F20 PINAL 1 10/21/94 Page 11. 


BURNS 
Pish-posh. It will be like taking 
candy from a baby. 


Through the binoculars, Burns sees a baby sitting ina 
nearby yard eating a large candy cane. 


BURNS (CONT’D) 
Say, that sounds like a larf. Let’s 
try it right now. (EXITS) 
BACK TO REALITY 
SMITHERS 
And when he tried to steal our 
sunlight, he crossed that line between 
everyday villainy and cartoonish super- 
villainy. 
A cartoonish super-villain leans out of a jail cell. 
SUPER-VILLAIN 
Bah! He was a rank amateur compared to 
Dr. Colossus! (EVIL LAUGH) 
Dr. Colossus pushes a button on his belt. His mechanical 
platform shoes grow four feet in height, SMACKING his head 
against the ceiling. 
SUPER-VILLAIN (CONT’D) 
(RUBBING HIS HEAD) Ow. When is my 
lawyer coming? 
INT. POLICE STATION - HALLWAY - LATER 


Smithers is escorted down the hall as reporters and 
cameramen crowd around. 


2F20 FINAL 1 10/21/94 Page 12. 


REPORTERS 
Mr. Smithers! / Smithers! / Over here, 
Waylon! / (ETC.) 

DAVE SHUTTON 
Dave Shutton, Springfield Daily 
Shopper. Who are you? Where are you 
going? 

KENT BROCKMAN 
Oh, do your research, Shutton! (TO 
SMITHERS) Ah, Kent Brockman, Channel 
Six News. How does it feel to be 
accused of the attempted murder of your 
boss and mentor? 

SMITHERS 
Kent, I, I feel about as low as Madonna 
when she found out she missed Tailhook. 

REPORTERS 
(APPRECIATIVE CHUCKLES) 

KENT BROCKMAN 
I’m going to say "ouch!" for Madonna. 

INT. KRUSTY’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 
KRUSTY watches this on TV. 

KRUSTY 

(OUTRAGED) Hey! That’s my Madonna 


gag! That guy stole my gag! 


2F20 FINAL 1 10/21/94 Page 13. 


SIDESHOW MEL 
And you stole it from last Friday’s 
episode of "Pardon My Zinger." 
KRUSTY 
Stole, made-up, what’s the difference? 
(NERVOUS LAUGH) 
SIDESHOW MEL 
Mr. Smithers must have seen that 
program, too. He never misses it. 
Krusty turns to MEL and raises one eyebrow questioningly. 
Mel takes a puff from a meerschaum pipe, a la Sherlock 
Holmes. 
SIDESHOW MEL (CONT’D) 
At the town meeting, he mentioned that 
he watched Comedy Central. I made sure 
to note that, as it seemed quite 
unusual. (BEAT THEN: EYES WIDEN) Ye 
Gods. To the police station, Krusty! 
INT. POLICE STATION - A FEW MINUTES LATER 
Krusty and Mel burst through the doors. 
SIDESHOW MEL 
I am Melvin Van Horne, and this is my 
associate Herschel Krustofsky. 
Officers, you have arrested an innocent 
man! 
WIGGUM 
Really? Aw, jeez. 


Wiggum pushes a button and a cell door slides open. 


2F20 FINAL 1 10/21/94 Page 


WIGGUM (CONT’D) 
All right, Colossus, you’re free to go. 
But stay away from Death Mountain. 
SUPER-VILLAIN 
(WHINY) But all my stuff is there. 
Dr. Colossus exits sadly. 
SIDESHOW MEL 
(CLEARS THROAT) I was referring to 
Waylon Smithers. Mr. Burns was shot 
Friday at 3:00 p.m. -- the very time 
that Smithers was at home watching 
"Pardon My Zinger." So you see, he 
couldn’t have done it. 
SMITHERS 
(GASP) Yes! You're right! I remember 
now! I - I watched that entire show! 
In fact... 
SMITHERS’ FLASHBACK - EXT. TOWN HALL - A LOT LESS BLURRY 


A drunken Smithers stumbles hurriedly outside, checking his 
watch. 


SMITHERS (V.O.) 
I left the town meeting early so I 
could get home in time. 

SMITHERS 
(SLURRING) Agh. I’ve gotta run, or 
I‘11 miss the opening rank-out. 


He staggers quickly down the sidewalk, until his way is 
blocked by the hunched-over figure -- JASPER. 


14. 


2F20 FINAL 1 10/21/94 


SMITHERS (CONT’D) 
(ANGRY DRUNKEN MURMURING) 
JASPER 
Slow down! The sidewalk’s fer reg’lar 
walkin’, not fer fancy-walkin’. 
Smithers tries to get around, but Jasper grabs his arm. 
SMITHERS 
(STRUGGLING SOUNDS) 
JASPER 


You simmer down, I’11 letcha go. 


Page 15. 


Smithers pulls out his gun, SHOOTS Jasper in the leg, and 


runs off. 
BACK TO REALITY 
SMITHERS 
(GLUM) So... Instead of wounding an 
evil old man, I may have killed an 
innocent old man. That’s much worse. 
KRUSTY 
About 50,000 volts worse, if you know 
what I mean. (MAKES SWITCH-PULLING 
GESTURE) Eeeeh! Bzzzt! Sizzle... 
WIGGUM 
Wait a minute. If a second old geezer 
got shot, how come nobody reported it? 


INT. RETIREMENT CASTLE - HALLWAY - MINUTES LATER 


Jasper answers his door, apparently unhurt. The cops and 


Smithers are a bit taken aback. 


2F20 FINAL 1 10/21/94 Page 16. 


WIGGUM 
Uh, hi. Uh, can we take a look at your 
leg? 
Jasper bends down, turns a few screws, and slides an 
artificial leg out of his pants. He hands it over. There 
is a bullet lodged in it. 
JASPER 
Yeah, that’s real spruce. You like it? 
SMITHERS 
Phew. Thank God. Sir, I, I only hope 
you can forgive me for shooting your 
wooden leg. 
JASPER 
You shot who in the what now? 
WIGGUM 
Okay, Smithers, you’re free to go. (TO 
JASPER) And you, one question: do you 
know who shot Mr. Burns, cause we’re 


really up the creek on this one. 


FADE OUT: 


END OF ACT ONE

AcT TWO 
FADE IN: SCENE 4 
INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - TV ROOM - NIGHT 
The family is watching TV. 
KENT BROCKMAN (ON TV) 
And with the prime suspect cleared and 
found completely innocent, we must now 
ask ourselves: "Who could possibly be 
as bloodthirsty as Waylon Smithers?" 
MARGE 
I guess it’s never the most likely 
suspect. 
LISA 
Actually, Mom, in 95% of cases, it is. 
The rest of the time, it’s usually some 
deranged lunatic who did it for no 
reason. 
Everyone looks at Homer. 
HOMER 
Hey, I had a damn good reason. He 
could never remember my name... 
FLASHBACK FROM PART ONE - BURNS’S OFFICE 
Homer charges at Burns and begins shaking him violently. 
HOMER (SIMULT. W/ BURNS) 


Homer Simpson! Homer Simpson! (ETC.) 


Page 17. 


2F20 FINAL 1 10/21/94 Page 18. 


BURNS (SIMULT. W/ HOMER) 
(BEING SHAKEN) What? / Eh? / Make 
sense, man! / I can barely understand 
what you’re saying! / Speak up? / How’s 
that? (ETC.) 

BACK TO REALITY 

LISA 
Well, I don’t think anyone in this 
family is capable of attempted murder. 

GRAMPA 
Eh, you never know what you’re capable 
of. I never thought I could shoot down 
a German plane -- but last year, I 
proved myself wrong. 

LISA 
Nancy Drew says that all you need to 
solve a mystery is an inquisitive 
temperament and two good friends. And 
I’ve got an inquisitive temperament! 
Maybe I could help solve this! 

MARGE 
(ANNOYED MURMUR) TI think you’re a 
little young to be investigating an 
attempted murder. Why don’t you try to 
solve the mystery of who put that mud 
in the freezer? 


Bart enters from the kitchen, carrying a tray with five 
bowls on it. 


2F20 FINAL 1 10/21/94 Page 19. 


BART 
Who wants chocolate ice cream? 
HOMER 
Me! Me! Me, me! 
ESTABLISHING SHOT - SPRINGFIELD HOSPITAL - DAY 
INT. HOSPITAL - BURNS’ ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Chief Wiggum and Dr. Hibbert stand over a comatose Burns. 
Hibbert switches on an x-ray display and gestures to the 
bullet right next to Burns’s heart. (We also see Burns has 
a small, vestigial tail.) 
DR. HIBBERT 
I’m afraid removing the bullet could be 
extremely dangerous. 
WIGGUM 
Aw, come on! It’s the closest thing to 
a clue we have. If you take it out, 
I’1l let you do one really illegal 
thing. 
HIBBERT’S THOUGHT BALLOON 
A CHUCKLING, nude Dr. Hibbert streaks out of the 
Springfield Art Museum carrying the Charles Demuth painting 
"I Saw the Figure Five In Gold." 
BACK TO SCENE 
DR. HIBBERT 
(CHUCKLES) Well, I suppose there might 
be a way... 
INT. HOSPITAL - OPERATING ROOM - LATER 
Dr. Hibbert operates as Wiggum looks on. He removes the 


bullet from Burns and DROPS it onto a tray. The BEEPING 
vital signs go wild. 


2F20 FINAL 1 10/21/94 Page 20. 


BURNS 
(CONVULSIONS & AGONIZED MOANS) 
DR. HIBBERT 
Hurry! We’re losing him! 
Wiggum takes out his gun, aims very carefully, and SHOOTS a 
new bullet precisely into the old bullet hole. (The vital 
signs return to normal.) 
BURNS 
(SOOTHED PURR) 
INT. POLICE STATION - THE NEXT DAY 
The police pass around the bullet in a plastic bag. 
WIGGUM 
Okay, boys. Now that we’ve got a clue, 
let’s discuss the, um... 


He consults a book titled "TEN TRITE TALES by Agatha 
Christie." 


WIGGUM (CONT’D) 
"Motive." (MOH-TIVE) 

LISA (0.S.) 
Mr. Burns is the richest man in town. 
Maybe it was about money. 

WIGGUM 
That’s some good thinking, Lou. 

LOU 
Thanks, Chief. 


Lisa jumps up and down in front of the desk, trying to make 
herself seen. 


2F20 FINAL 1 10/21/94 Page 21. 


LISA 
Hey! I said that. My name is Lisa 
Simpson, and I made a chart of all the 
suspects in the Burns case. Look. 


They gather around Lisa as she points to her handmade 
chart. As she speaks, we see clips of the suspects. 


LISA 
Mr. Burns hurt all these people 
financially: nightclub owner Moe 
Szyslak. His bar was closed because of 
Burns’ negligence; liquor connoisseur 
Barney Gumble. When Moe’s closed, 
Barney lost his only means of support - 
- sucking coins out of the Love Tester 
machine. 

EDDIE 
That’s a real good way to get sick. 

LISA 
Dedicated educator Principal Seymour 
Skinner. His school lost millions when 
Burns pirated its oil well; and 
grounds-tender Groundskeeper Willie. 
He lost his job and his dream of owning 
a space-age leaf blower. 

WIGGUM 
Hey, what about that jazz teacher that 
got laid off? You know, um, Johnny 


Mambo? Mister Salsa? Senor Samba? 


2F20 FINAL 1 10/21/94 Page 22. 


LISA 
Tito Puente? 

WIGGUM 
Yeah. 

LISA 


(LAUGHS) Well, he did vow revenge. 
(OFF THEIR INTRIGUED LOOKS) But I 
can’t see him doing something illegal - 
- he’s in show business! He’s a 
celebrit-- 
WIGGUM 

Let’s roll, boys. 

EXT. STREET - A LITTLE LATER 


The squad car pulls up in front of a nightclub called "Chez 
Guevara. Palacio de Dansa Cubana." 


INT. NIGHTCLUB - A FEW MINUTES LATER 
The cops are questioning Tito Puente. 
TITO PUENTE 

Revenge? Of course. But why wound his 
body with bullets when I can set his 
soul afire with a slanderous mambo? 
Listen, if you will, to my revenge. 
Uno, dos, tres... 


Puente and his band strike up a THROBBING LATIN BEAT. 


2F20 PINAL 1 10/21/94 Page 23. 


PUENTE & BAND 
(SINGING) Wounds won’t last long / But 
an insulting song / Burns will always 
carry with him. /// So I’11l settle my 
score / On the samba floor / With this 
vengeful Latin rhythm! 

CROONER 
Bu-urns! Con el corazon de perro! / 
Senor Bu-urns! El diablo con dinero! 

PUENTE & BAND 
(BIG FINISH) It may not surprise you / 
But all of us despise you. / Please die 
/ And fry / In hell / You rotten / Rich 
/ Old wretch! 

BAND 
(IN UNISON) Adios, viejo! 

WIGGUM, EDDIE & LOU 
(APPLAUSE) 

WIGGUM 
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, okay, I 
believe you’re innocent. Gee, I hope 
all the suspects are this much fun. 

SMASH CUT TO: 
INT. SCHOOL - PRINCIPAL’S OFFICE - LATER 
Principal Skinner sits perfectly still behind his 


immaculate desk as a loud clock TICKS. The stultified 
police fight off DROWSINESS. 


2F20 FINAL 1 10/21/94 Page 24. 


SKINNER 
(SLOW) Hum-m-m. Now-now let, let... 
me... think. 
WIGGUM 
(SIGH) 
SKINNER 
(BEAT) Now, I did - I did go to the 
town meeting with the intention of 
ambushing Mr. Burns. When it 
adjourned, I rushed to the lavatory to 
apply my camouflage makeup... 
FLASHBACK - TOWN HALL - INSIDE THE MEN’S ROOM 
We see Skinner from behind, working feverishly in front of 
a mirror. He turns around, and he’s wearing lipstick, 
rouge, and eyeliner, looking like a garish old hag. 
SKINNER 
Blast! I took mother’s makeup kit by 
mistake. 
Superintendent Chalmers enters. 
SUPERINTENDENT CHALMERS 
Oh, uh, excuse me, ma’am. 
SKINNER 
Superintendent Chalmers! 
SUPERINTENDENT CHALMERS 
(REALIZING; SICKENED) Oh my God! 


Just then, there is a GUNSHOT outside. The two exchange 
even more shocked glances.

BACK TO REALITY 
WIGGUM 
So Superintendent Chalmers can vouch 
for your whereabouts? 
SKINNER 
Oh yes. But, anything else he tells 
you is a filthy lie. 
SCENE 6 
INT. POLICE STATION - INTERROGATION ROOM - LATER 


The cops sit opposite Groundskeeper Willie, who is ona 
chair under bright lights. He is wearing his kilt. 


WILLIE 
I’m tellin’ ya, I could nay have shot 
Burns! 
Willie uncrosses and recrosses his legs a la Sharon Stone, 
revealing everything to the MORTIFIED police officers. 
Eddie aims his gun at Willie. 
EDDIE 
This is your last warning about that. 
WILLIE 
It’s impossible for me to fire a 
pistol. If you'll check me medical 
records, you’ll see I have a cripplin’ 
arthritis in me index fingers! Look at 
‘em! 


He holds up both his gnarled index fingers and makes 
button-pushing gestures. 


25. 


2F20 FINAL 1 10/21/94 


WILLIE (CONT’D) 
I got it from Space Invaders in the 
70’s. 
WIGGUM 
Oh yeah, that was a pretty addictive 
video game. 
WILLIE 
Video game? 
INT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT 
Moe is being given a lie detector test. 
EDDIE 
Did you hold a grudge against 
Montgomery Burns? 
MOE 
No. 
The machine emits a PIERCING BEEP. 
MOE (CONT’D) 
All right, maybe I did. But I didn’t 
shoot him. 
This time, the machine emits an affirmative CHIME. 
EDDIE 
Checks out. Okay, Sir, you’re free to 


go. 


Page 26. 


2F20 FINAL 1 10/21/94 Page 27. 


MOE 
Good, cause I got a hot date tonight. 
(BEEP) A date. (BEEP) Dinner with 
friends. (BEEP) Dinner alone. (BEEP) 
Watching TV alone. (BEEP) All right. 
I’m gonna sit at home and ogle the 
ladies in the Victoria’s Secret 
catalog. (BEEP) (ASHAMED) Sears 
catalog. 
The machine sounds its affirmative CHIME. 
MOE (CONT’D) 
Wouldja unhook this, already please?! 
I don’t deserve this kind of shabby 
treatment! (BEEP) 
INT. POLICE STATION - DAY 
The officers are questioning Barney. 
BARNEY 
Do they still serve free hot meals in 
prison? 
WIGGUM 
Sure. They got tripesteak, turkaroni, 
porkwads, you name it. 
BARNEY 
Oh, boy. I’m your man! I stabbed Mr. 


Burns! 


2F20 FINAL 1 10/21/94 Page 28. 


WIGGUM 
Oh, beat it! And don’t come back ‘till 
you’ve shot somebody. 
BARNEY 
You got it! 
INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY 
Grampa sits at the kitchen table, pouring orange juice into 
a bowl of cereal. Marge enters, carrying Grampa’s empty 
cigar box. 
MARGE 
(UPSET) Grampa, I found your cigar box 
dug up in the backyard, but the gun 
wasn’t there. Have you seen it? 
GRAMPA 
You accuse me of everything around 
here. (SARCASTIC) Who put slippers in 
the dishwasher? Who threw a cane at 
the TV? Who fell into the china hutch? 
MARGE 
I was just asking if you’d seen it. 
There’s no need to be a prickly pear. 


Marge exits. After a beat, Grampa reaches under his 
sweater and pulls out the gun. He fondles it lovingly. 


GRAMPA 
Just you and me, old friend. (BEAT) 
What? What do you mean you’re not my 
friend? 


He points the gun at himself and puts his other hand up in 
surrender. 


2F20 FINAL 1 10/21/94 Page 29. 


GRAMPA (CONT’D) 
Okay, okay. But you’re not going to 
get away with this. 
He backs awkwardly off screen. 
INT. POLICE STATION - MIDNIGHT 


Wiggum sits at his desk, looking stymied. All the suspects 
on Lisa’s chart have been crossed off. 


WIGGUM 
We’ve eliminated all of our suspects 
and we’re still not close. Oh, this is 
gonna be an all-night brain buster. 
Better drink some coffee. 


Wiggum rolls his chair over to the coffee machine and sees 
it’s empty. 


WIGGUM (CONT’D) 
Oh, we’re out of coffee. Oh well, 1/11 
just drink this warm cream. 
Wiggum takes a sip and actually falls asleep as he’s 
drinking. His head rolls back onto the table as he SNORES 
contentedly. 
WIGGUM’S DREAM 
A "Twin Peaks"-style JAZZ riff plays. Chief Wiggum sits on 
a couch in a red-curtained room with a black & white 
checked floor. He is eating a donut. Lisa enters with a 
weird, jerky walk. She sounds like she’s talking 
backwards, but isn’t. 
LISA 
(BACKWARDS VOICE) Chief Wig-gum... 
Don’t eat... the clues. 
He takes the donut away from his mouth. It is no longer a 


donut, but a playing card: the ace of hearts. Its edges 
are on fire. 


2F20 PINAL 1 10/21/94 Page 30. 


LISA (CONT’D) 
This suit burns better. Look. 


She holds up a large ace of spades, which is totally 
engulfed in flames. 


WIGGUM 

Huh? 
LISA 

Better... look... burns... suit. 
WIGGUM 


I’m not following you. 
LISA 
Burns suit! Burns suit! (NORMAL 
VOICE) 
WIGGUM 
Huh? 
LISA 
Look at Burns’ suit. Yeesh. 
BACK TO REALITY 


Wiggum JOLTS awake. His hair is sticking up in a weird 
cowlick. Eddie enters. 


EDDIE 
I had an idea, Chief. Why don’t we 
check out that suit Burns was wearing 
when he got shot? 

WIGGUM 
Did you have that same backwards- 


talking dream with the flamin’ cards? 


2F20 FINAL 1 10/21/94 Page 31. 


EDDIE 
(SHOOTS HIM A LEERY LOOK) I’11 drive. 
INT. HOSPITAL - BURNS’ ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT 
Eddie, Lou, and Smithers look on as Wiggum stands in the 
closet, examining Burns’ suit with a magnifying glass. He 
finds an eyelash on the sleeve. 
WIGGUM 
Eureka! 


INT. HOSPITAL - LAB - A FEW MINUTES LATER 


The eyelash appears on the screen of an electron 
microscope. 


TECHNICIAN 
(WISEGUY VOICE) Ooh, nice eyelash. 
Yours? 
WIGGUM 
No. We need to find out who it 
belonged to. We want a D.N.A. test. 
TECHNICIAN 
Ooh, ooh, ee, ooh, ooh... That takes 8 
to 10 weeks. 


The technician shifts expectantly from side to side. 
Wiggum SIGHS and slips him a carton of cigarettes. 


TECHNICIAN (CONT’D) 
Did I say weeks? ‘Cause I meant 
seconds. 


He places the eyelash in another machine and pushes a 
button. 


WIGGUM 
Whaddya got the whole town’s D.N.A. on 


file? 


2F20 FINAL 1 10/21/94 Page 


TECHNICIAN 
Yuh-huh. If you’ve ever handled a 
penny, the government’s got yer D.N.A. 
Whyddya think they keep ’em in 
circulation? 


The computer starts scrolling through a long batch of 
names. 


TECHNICIAN (CONT’D) 
Scan’s finished. Now it’s gonna narrow 
it down to the family bloodline. 


The machine finishes and BEEPS. It prints out "MATCH 
FOUND... SIMPSON." 


INT. HOSPITAL - BURNS’ ROOM - THAT MINUTE 
Eddie, Lou, and Smithers sit near Burns’ bed, reading. 
Suddenly, the life support machines begin to BEEP and CLICK 
wildly. The three men jump to their feet and rush to his 
side. Burns’ eyelids flutter open, and he shoots straight 
up. 
BURNS 
Homer Simpson! 
EDDIE 
Bingo. The gunman has a name-o. 
The cops CHARGE OFF down the hall. 
EDDIE & LOU (0.S.) 
Chief! Chief! Chief! 
SMITHERS 
(NEAR TEARS) Sir! You’re awake! 


Don’t worry, Sir, we’ll have you up and 


hunched over in no time. 


32. 


2F20 FINAL 1 10/21/94 Page 33. 


INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - EARLY THAT MORNING 
The police BURST through the front door and begin 
RANSACKING the house. Bart, Lisa, and Grampa rush 
downstairs. Marge, holding Maggie, and Homer, holding a 
glass of milk, rush in from the kitchen. 
LISA 
Hey, Chief Wiggum, what are you doing? 
What’s going on? 
WIGGUM 
I’m sorry, kid. We got Simpson D.N.A. 
on Burns’ clothing and a positive I.D. 
on your father. 
SIMPSONS 
(SHOCKED GASPS) 
BART 
D.N.A., positive I.D. -- Those won’t 
hold up in any court -- Run, Dad! 
Bart tries to push Homer out the door, but instead pushes 
him into an entering Lou, who wears a rubber glove and is 
carrying a pistol. 
LOU 
Hey-ho. Look what I found under Mr. 
Simpson’s car seat. 


Homer sets down his milk. (Lou passes the gun to Eddie, 
who begins dusting it with a small brush.) 


HOMER 
I swear, I’ve never seen that gun 


before. 


2F20 FINAL 1 10/21/94 Page 


EDDIE (0.S.) 
Then why are your fingerprints all over 
it, sir? 
They turn to see Eddie holding up the pistol and Homer's 
milk glass. Both have visible, dusted fingerprints on 
then. 
HOMER 
(SHRIEK) 
Wiggum takes out the evidence bag containing the bullet. 
He opens the pistol and removes one of the remaining five 
bullets. They match up. 
WIGGUM 
This is the gun that shot Mr. 
Burns. (SLAPS CUFFS ON HOMER) Homer 
Simpson, you’re under arrest for 
attempted murder. 
HOMER 
(DISTRAUGHT ANNOYED GRUNT) 
WIGGUM 
Yeah, that’s what they all say. 
...They all say, "D’oh." 
FADE OUT: 


END OF AcT TWO 


34, 


2F20 FINAL 1 10/21/94 Page 35. 


FADE IN: SCENE 8 
INT. PADDY WAGON - A LITTLE LATER 


Homer, in handcuffs, sits by himself in the rear of the 
paddy wagon, dejected. 


HOMER 
I don’t think I shot him, but there’s 
so much evidence. Maybe I blacked out 
and went nuts, like during the S.A.T. 
HOMER’S BRAIN (V.O.) 
(STERN) Homer, up here, this is your 
brain. I’m pretty sure you didn’t do 
it. Now listen. Me, your stomach, 
and, er, a couple of the other body 
parts really do not want you to go to 
prison. We have to clear your name... 
The CAMERA MOVES through the wall to... 
INT. PADDY WAGON - CAB - CONTINUOUS 
Chief Wiggum (in the driver’s seat) and Lou have pulled up 
to the Krustyburger drive-thru and are ordering into the 
speaker. 
WIGGUM 
And two orders of Bite-Size Breakfast 
Pancakes. With extra dipping sauce. 
TEENAGE EMPLOYEE (V.0.) 
(SQUEAKY VOICE) Please pull up to the 
service window, please. 
Wiggum starts to pull up, when he notices an overhang above 


the service window reading "CLEARANCE: 7 FT." The wagon 
won’t fit. 


2F20 FINAL 1 10/21/94 Page 


WIGGUM 
Aw! I don’t wanna have to get out. 
Ah, I’11 just drive up on the curb. 
He steers the paddy wagon up onto the high right curb, 
CRUSHING all the bushes. With its right wheels on the 
curb, the wagon tilts at a precarious angle. They pull up, 
and Wiggum leans way, way out, trying to reach the food 
being handed to him. 
WIGGUM (CONT’D) 
Ergh... Blugh... Almost got it... 


As he leans further out and takes hold of the food, the 
extra weight causes the wagon to start tipping over. 


LOU (0.S.) 
Drop the food, Chief!! 
WIGGUM 
Nooooco! 
INT. PADDY WAGON - CONTINUOUS 
Homer is thrown about as the wagon falls onto its side and 
the back door flies open. As he struggles to get up, he 
hears the sound of something approaching and looks out. We 
hear an OMINOUS SYMPHONIC SWELL, a la "The Fugitive." 
HOMER’S P.O.V. 
Jasper, in his Model A, rounds the corner of the drive-thru 
lane. He is heading straight for the wagon at about 5 
m.p-h. He sounds his KLAXON, but doesn’t stop. 
JASPER 
Dang fools. Drive-thru’s not fer 
a-parkin’. 
Homer pulls himself from the wreckage. Jasper yanks his 
hand brake, but the Model A skids towards Homer with a 
horrific SCREECHING of metal. At the very last second, 
Homer dives over the bushes to freedom as Jasper plows into 


the paddy wagon. Both vehicles slide through the drive- 
thru with an unbelievable CACOPHONY OF SOUND EFFECTS. 


36. 


2F20 FINAL 1 10/21/94 Page 37. 


TEENAGE EMPLOYEE 
Dianne, I’m going to take my break 
now... 
INT. HOSPITAL - BURNS’S ROOM - THAT MORNING 


Burns is sitting up in bed, eating breakfast alone. Dr. 
Nick Riviera enters with a clipboard. 


DR. NICK RIVIERA 
Hi, everybody! 
BURNS 
(WAVING; A LA "HI, DR. NICK") Ho, 
Mersimp Son! 
DR. NICK RIVIERA 
(SLIGHTLY ALARMED) Okay, that was a 
little strange. Um tell me, how are 
you feeling today? 
BURNS 
(TRYING TO SAY SOMETHING ELSE) Ho- 
mer... Simpson, Homer. (SAID AS 
PROFANITY; ANNOYED GRUNT) Simpson! 
Dr. Nick looks in Burns’ eyes with a small flashlight. 
DR. NICK RIVIERA 
Hmm... That seems to be all you can 
say. When you were in that coma, did 
you feel your brain getting damaged? 
INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - KITCHEN - A LITTLE LATER 


Lisa sits at the kitchen table with Marge. 


2F20 FINAL 1 10/21/94 Page 38. 


MARGE 
(VERY CONCERNED) The police have such 
a strong case against Homer. Mr. Burns 
said he did it, they have Homer’s 
D.N.A... 
LISA 
They have Simpson D.N.A. It could’ve 
come from any of us. Except you, since 
you’re a Bouvier. 
MARGE 
No. No, no. When I took your father’s 
name, I took everything that came with 
it, including D.N.A. 
LISA 
(WEIRDED OUT) Okay, Mom. Anyway, my 
point is, the evidence isn’t as 
concrete as it seems. Like those 
fingerprints. They could’ve gotten on 
the gun some other way. 
LISA’S FLASHBACK - SIMPSON CAR 
Lisa sits in the passenger seat, eating a banana. Homer 
holds an ice cream cone in each hand and steers with his 
knees. 
LISA 
Are you sure you don’t want me to hold 


one of your ice cream cones? 


2F20 FINAL 1 10/21/94 Page 39. 


HOMER 
(DERISIVE SNORT) Yeah, right. You 
chose fruit, you live with fruit. 


The car HITS a bump, and one of Homer’s scoops flies off 
and rolls under the driver’s seat. 


HOMER (CONT’D) 
(WHINY ANNOYED GRUNT) 
He reaches down and feels around for it. We see his 
fingers touch: an eight-track tape labelled "Pipin’ Hot 
Bread"; a pineapple-shaped and scented air freshener; and 
the gun. Homer withdraws his hand to find a green lollipop 
stuck to it. 
HOMER (CONT’D) 
No. No. No. Ewww. Why is this on the 
floor? 


He daintily places it in his shirt pocket and pats it 
protectively. 


BACK TO REALITY 
LISA 
And we don’t even know whose gun that 
was. Maybe somebody planted it there 
to frame Dad. 
Their gaze drifts over to Grampa. 
MARGE 
No. We can’t start thinking that way 
about our own family members. 


Suspicion could tear us apart. 


2F20 FINAL 1 10/21/94 


GRAMPA 
That’s right. We all gotta stick 
together if we’re going to have any 
hope of bringing that awful Homer to 
justice. 
INT. POLICE STATION - A FEW HOURS LATER SCENE 9 


A press conference is in progress. Chief Wiggum has his 
arm in a sling and a bandage on his head. 


WIGGUM 
Here is a photo of the fugitive from 
our files. 


He holds up a blown-up mugshot of Homer, who has a black 
eye and is wearing a "Haig in ’88" t-shirt. 


WIGGUM (CONT’D) 
And now Waylon Smithers -- ah who has 
been a real good sport about that 
wrongful arrest thing (RELIEVED 
WHISTLE; LAUGH) -- has a statement that 
he would like to make. Waylon? 

SMITHERS 
Thank you. As Montgomery Burns’ 
closest friend, I am certain that there 
is nothing he would want more than 
swift, brutal revenge against Homer 
Simpson. Therefore, I am offering a 
$50,000 reward for his capture. Dead 


or alive.

2F20 FINAL 1 10/21/94 Page 41. 


CROWD 
(EXCITED FRENZY) 
WIGGUM 
Me first! Me first! 
The cops and reporters charge out. 
INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - TV ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Marge and the kids watch this on TV. Marge is quite upset. 
MARGE 
Oh, my goodness! I just pray he comes 
here before any of those lunatics find 
him. 
The doorbell RINGS. Bart answers it to reveal Patty and 
Selma. Patty is wearing night-vision goggles, and Selma is 
carrying a crate labelled "TRANQUILIZER DARTS." 
PATTY 
Hello, Bart. Is your father in? 
INT. HOSPITAL - BURNS’S ROOM - A FEW MINUTES LATER 


Burns awakens to find someone standing over him ina 
doctor’s coat. He looks up to see it’s Homer. 


BURNS 
Homer Simpson? 
HOMER 
(QUIET RAGE) So you finally learned my 
name, eh? 
Burns shakes his head "no." 
BURNS 


Homer Simpson. 


2F20 FINAL 1 10/21/94 Page 42. 


HOMER 
(CONFUSED BEAT) I’ve got no time for 
your demented parlor games! (OMINOUS) 
You won’t be telling anyone else that 
Homer Simpson shot you. 
Homer advances on Mr. Burns. 
EXT. TOWN HALL - THAT MINUTE 


Lisa walks around the town hall parking lot, lost in 
thought. 


LISA 
The scene of the crime! There must be 
something here that can clear Dad. 
A PIGEON lands on something nearby. 
PIGEON 
(COOING) Clue, clue. 
Lisa turns her head toward the something. 
LISA 
(REALIZING) That’s it! Oh, Mr. 
Pigeon, I’d kiss you if you weren’t 
swimming with disease. 
Her memory flashes to: 
SLOW MOTION - BLACK & WHITE 
Burns, shot, staggers out of the parking lot. His jacket 
flutters open, and we clearly see his shoulder holster is 
empty. 
BACK TO LISA 


She follows Burns’s path to the front of the town hall. 


2F20 FINAL 1 10/21/94 Page 43. 


LISA 
(GASP) So, the D.N.A. was right. It 
must’ve been... Oh, Dad! 


Eddie is hanging out nearby, leaning against his 
motorcycle. His police radio CRACKLES to life. 


POLICE DISPATCHER (V.O.) 
Attention all units. Homer Simpson has 
been sighted. Proceed at once to 
Marvin Monroe Memorial Hospital. 
LISA 
(GASP) 
Eddie ZOOMS off. Lisa jumps on her bike and follows, 
pedaling as fast as she can. A second later, a MOB of 
bounty hunters races past (including Otto with some rope, 
the Sea Captain with a harpoon and net, and Lunchlady Doris 
carrying mace and wearing a gas mask.) 
APU 
Be careful when we capture him! We 
cannot claim the reward unless we have 
51% of the carcass. 


EXT. HOSPITAL - FRONT STEPS - ONE MINUTE LATER 


Lisa leaps off her bike and rushes into the hospital, just 
ahead of the police and the mob. 


INT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - TEN SECONDS LATER 


Lisa runs down the hall towards Burns’ room. Smithers and 
the cops, guns in hand, close in from the other direction. 


LISA 
Wait! Stop! Don’t shoot my Dad! 


CONTINUED...

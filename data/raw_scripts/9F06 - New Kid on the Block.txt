"HUNKS". There are TWO GUYS in open shirts, THREE GIRLS in 
mini-skirts, and a SMIRKING HOST. The two guys are covered 
with little paste-on hearts. 
HOST 
©.K., Ron, which one of our girls 
said the following about you: "He 
looked so sexy, I hoped we would have 
sex." 
HUNK 
(SMUG) Well, that’s a tough one 
‘cause I did the nasty with Uta, 
Candi, and Shasta. 
GIRLS 
Hee hee! It’s true, all right! 
HUNK 
Huh, huh, but, I’m going to have to 
go with Shasta ‘cause she liked 
makin’ bacon on the beach. 
PULL BACK to reveal Homer watching TV. 
HOMER 


Ooh, me too.

DREAM VANISHES. Homer goes to the door. Old MRS. WINFIELD 


is there. 

MRS. WINFIELD 
Mr. Simpson, my husband and I have 
decided to move... 

HOMER 
Gonna run out the clock in Florida, 
eh? 

MRS. WINFIELD 
Yes, well, there’s a few things you 
could do to help us sell our home. 
First, whenever you walk in front of 
your window could you please wear 
pants? 

HOMER 
Mmm... no. 

MRS. WINFIELD 
Second, could you please take in your 
jack-o-lanterns from past Halloweens. 

HOMER 


Hey, I’m not going near those things.

MRS. WINFIELD 
And please cover your garbage. It’s 
attracting wildlife. 
We see a MOOSE eating out of Homer’s garbage. 
HOMER 
Wha... hey, moose! Shoo! 


The moose points its antlers towards Homer and paws the 
ground menacingly, about to charge. 


He SLAMS the door in Mrs. Winfield’s face. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. SIMPSON HOUSE - LAWN - DAY 
There is a "FOR SALE" sign in front of the Winfields’ 
house. Homer is MOWING the lawn as he notices a pile of 
junk and old newspapers that they left on the curb. 
HOMER 
Hello, what’s this? Wire hangers! 
Expired medicine! Old newspapers! 
(BREATHES FAST THEN COLLECTS HIMSELF) 
O.K., Homer, stay calm. Just quietly 
get this stuff inside your house. 
Homer drops some hangers, which land NOISILY. 
HOMER (CONT’D) 
(STERN) Homer, you’re not listening! 
INT. SIMPSON HOUSE =- LIVING ROOM - LATER 
Homer is sitting on the couch, surrounded by the junk we 
saw on the curb. Marge enters. Homer opens one of the 
Winfields’ medicine bottles, and fills his hand with pills. 
MARGE 


That medicine’s not for you.

MARGE 
Gimme that. 
ON TV 
A commercial comes on. 
CAPTAIN 


Ahoy, maties. Had your fill of tacos? 
Would you sooner eat a bilge rat than 
another burger? Then come for all- 
you-can-eat seafood at the "FRYING 
DUTCHMAN." 

The Captain indicates numerous plates of seafood. 

ON HOMER 

He has his head tilted back on the couch.

flagship of the Avenue K Strip Mall. 


HOMER 
Aye, aye Captain! Marge, we’re going 
to that restaurant. 

MARGE 
But I think I’m allergic to seafood. 
The last time I had it, my throat 
closed up and I went into 
convulsions. 

HOMER 
You gotta get right back on that 
horse, Marge. 

MARGE

INT. WINFIELD HOUSE - FRONT HALL - DAY 


A well-dressed Realtor, GARY PRICE, is showing a YOUNG 
COUPLE the house. 


WOMAN 
Now, I don’t know much about haggling 
or bargaining, so why don’t we just 
agree to pay whatever the Winfields 
want? 

PRICE 


That could work.

Suddenly, they hear a LOUD BELCH from the direction of the 
Simpson house. 


MAN 
What was that? 
PRICE 
Sigh. 
They go to the window. 
EXT. WINFIELD AND SIMPSON HOUSES - CONTINUOUS 


Homer is sitting in an inflatable kiddie pool on his front 
lawn. A few beer cans float in the water around him. 


HOMER 
(TO OBJECT IN THE POOL) There you 
are! Thought you’d get away, huh? 
Homer pulls a half-eaten hot dog in a bun out of the pool 
and eats it. PULL BACK reveals the couple’s shocked 
reaction to Homer. 
WOMAN 
(TO PRICE) Goodbye. 
The couple runs away. 
EXT. SIMPSON HOUSE - FRONT LAWN - A LITTLE LATER 
Price approaches Homer. 
PRICE 
Homer Simpson? 
HOMER

High School together and now you’re 


more successful.

Mr. Simpson, could you please take 
your soggy weiner inside? Your

HOMER 
How much you think it’s cost me? 
EXT. WINFIELD HOUSE - DAY 
We see a "SOLD" sign on the lawn. 
INT. WINFIELD BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS 
Bart and Lisa climb through a window. 
LISA 
I don’t think we should be down here. 
BART 
Nervous, Lis? I don’t blame you. 
This is where the Winfields hid their 
mutated son. 
LISA 
(SHARPLY) Bart! The Winfields didn’t 
have a son. 
Bart sees an old sock lying on the floor. 
BART 
See that sock over there? It was his 
only friend. 


Bart puts the sock on his hand.

Bart, that’s not funny. 

BART 
There are some who say the monster...

Bart turns back to Lisa, revealing that he has turned his 
eyelids inside-out. 


LISA 
Aaah! 
Lisa runs away. Bart CHUCKLES. Suddenly, LAURA, a fifteen 
year-old girl in an oversized army jacket, steps behind 
Bart. 
LAURA 
(ZOMBIE VOICE) Friend... friend... 
She grabs Bart. 
BART

He passes out. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
Blackness. Laura’s voice is barely audible. 
LAURA (V.0.)

Marge and Bart stand at the front door. 
LAURA 
My mother’s inside, Mrs. Simpson. 
Please go right on in. 
MARGE 
Oh, you speak so politely to adults. 
LAURA 
(CHIPPER) My upbringing was 
painfully strict, ma’am. 
MARGE 
That’s sweet. 
Marge goes inside, leaving Bart with Laura. 
INT. WINFIELD HOUSE 
Marge has laid out the contents of a basket labelled 
"Springfield Welcome Mobile". The coffee table in front of 
her is filled with worthless merchandise: nail file, shoe 
horn, clothes pins, and a coupon reading: "SPRINGFIELD 
QUIK-E-MART. HALF OFF ON EXPIRED MILK." 
MARGE 
+». and finally, Moe’s Tavern has 


contributed a coupon as their way of 


saying "Welcome to Springfield."

MRS. POWERS 
Thank you, this is all so nice. I 
actually had some doubts about moving 
to Springfield. Especially after 
that Time cover story, "America’s 
Worst City." 

MARGE 
You could see our house in that 
photo. 

MRS. POWERS 
Oh, hope I didn’t offend ya. 

MARGE 
Well, when you work for the 
Springfield Welcome Mobile, you meet 
a lot of unhappy people. 


Marge pulls a video cassette labeled "DAS BUTT -- Rated 
XXX" from her basket. 


MARGE 
(AWKWARD) And this is for the man of 
the house... which I guess... is you. 
(UNCOMFORTABLE MURMUR) 

MRS. POWERS 
I guess I should explain. Laura’s 
father and I divorced two years ago. 
Oh, they’re so sweet when you marry 
them, but soon it’s just career, 


career, career.

Laura punches him in the shoulder. 
BART 
Oh. 
LAURA 
Hurts, don’t it? (CHUCKLES) 
BART 
Do you 


(RUBBING SHOULDER) Uh, right. 

know what a Wet Willie is? 
LAURA 

Is it this? 


She wets her finger and jams it in Bart’s ear. Bart wipes 


his ear and rubs his shoulder. 
LAURA (CONT’D) 


In Germany they call it "der Wegen

finger.

She SPITS on his hand. 
LAURA (CONT’D)

See you later, Bart! 


She GIGGLES and runs into the house. Bart looks down at 
the spit on his hand.

I’1l never wash this hand again. 
MATCH CUT TO:

Behind her, sitting in a chair with a quilt on her lap, is 
ANOTHER WOMAN. She stares into space with a haunted look 
and MUTTERS.

it down, Bart. Bart, put it down... 
INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Homer sadly HANGS UP the phone. 
HOMER 
(MOANS) No "All You Can Eat

Homer raises his arms heavenward. 
BART 
Maybe Laura could watch us. 
LISA 
Oh, I get it. (TEASING) Bart, the 
baby-sitter’s here. Let me tuck you 
in. (KISSING NOISES, ETC.) 
BART 
Silence! 
He lunges at Lisa with the hand. She ducks and he hits the

Great. Oh, and there was something 
else. (THINKING) Something I was 
supposed to tiptoe around... 

MRS. POWERS 
My divorce. 

HOMER 
That’s it! Whew, I’m glad one of us 
remembered. That could have been 
embarrassing. 

MRS. POWERS 
Well I know what you’re thinking and 
the answer is yes, I want to be fixed 
up with one of your friends as soon 
as you can arrange it. After all, 
Homer, I do have the normal 


appetites.

Heh heh, I know what you mean. Just

HOMER 
Right. Me neither. (BEAT) We’re 
talking about sex, right? 
MRS. POWERS 
Right. 
HOMER 
(SLY) I hear you loud and clear. 
INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - BATHROOM - NIGHT 
Bart is taking a bath when Lisa walks in on hin. 
LISA 
Bart, are you taking a bath? 
BART 
Hey, sometimes a guy just likes his 
skin to look its yellowest. 
LISA 
This wouldn’t have anything to do 
with Laura coming over, would it? 
BART 
Maybe. Now be a dear and hand me the 


loofah.

Cute. What do you guys want for 
dinner?

I don’t care. (INDICATES BART) Ask 
Hef over there. 
BART 
Lady’s choice.

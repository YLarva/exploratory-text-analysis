Come on, Mom, the stores just invented 
this holiday to make money. 

HOMER .

Marge hands Homer his present. It’s a TEDDY BEAR holding 
heart balloons, with a sword and a knight’s helmet. 


MARGE 
For you, Homie. 
BEAR 
(ELECTRONIC VOICE) I'm Sir Loves-a- 
Lot, the bear who loves to love! 
HOMER 
They didn’t have Lord Huggington? 
| MARGE 
It’s the same basic bear, Homey. 
HOMER 
(DISAPPOINTED) I guess. 
He sets it down, facing away from him. BART OPENS a box 
containing a Halloween jack-o-lantern. It has a pair of 
red plastic lips slapped on, almost covering its evil 
smile. 
BART 
What the hell is cHies 
HOMER. 
It's a "Kisses-Make-Mé-Boogie-O- 


Lantern." 


5FO9 FINAL 3 11/26/97 


MARGE 
(HOLDING CAMERA) Kiss it and make it 
boogie! 
HOMER 
Kiss it. 
BART 
Uh, maybe later. 


Bart tosses it in the corner. A curious SANTA’S LITTLE 
HELPER licks the lantern. It VIBRATES feebly. 


HOMER 
(BOOGIEING) Oh-ho yeahhh... 

MARGE 
Well, we’d better start our Love Day 
clean-up. You kids take care of the

The GARBAGE TRUCK DRIVES by without seeing Homer and 
continues to the Flanders, where they pick up one tiny 
compacted bag of trash. 
HOMER (CONT'D) 
Hey wait! Stop! I have garbage! 
He HOISTS the can over his head and chases the truck down 


the street. Trash flies everywhere, and garbage water 
drips on his head.

the ground when he’s being dragged out. 


Page 2 - Only have the cigar smoke in the first shot of 
the old executive. 


Closer on the executive when he says "We need to cook 
up..." to make it look more conspiratorial.

tousle Bart’s hair.

logy at the beginning of the scene. 


Build Patterson’s acting in this scene. He should go 
from polite, to puzzled, to angry. 


Page 20 - Cheat the microphone closer to Homer. 
Page 22 - Don’t have Otto wearing his headphones. 


Page 25 - For Bono’s line "Don’t worry, folks..." Stay 
on Bono for the whole line and we should see the band 
come back onstage, strap on their instruments and get 
ready to play in the background. Call me. 


Page 31 - Avoid grotesque expressions during Homer’s 
"What button" speech. 


Page 34 --Have stacks of paper on the desk to make 
Homer look more busy. And make sure Homer has a 
nameplate just like Ray Patterson's. 


Loosen Homer’s tie so it looks like he’s been working 
hard. 


Make sure there's stuff on wall in the office, like map 
of city. 


Page 35 - Have Homer stand on line "Yes, I gotta work 
hard, honey." We want to get him over to the window 
quicker. 7 


Make sure through window, we can see Homer’s window is 
up high. 


Homer should land standing on the truck, not sitting. 
(Call me about this sequence.)

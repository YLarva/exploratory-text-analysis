FADE IN: 
INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - MORNING 


LISA and BART are fighting. MAGGIE watches, wide-eyed. 


BART 
oh, yeah? 

LISA 
Yeah! 

BART 
Oh, yeah? 

LISA 
Yeah! 

BART 
Oh, yeah? 

LISA 


Yeah!

Homer enters. 
HOMER 
Hey! What's the problem here? 
LISA 
We were fighting over which one of us 
loves you more. 
Homer SNIFFLES. There is a tear in his eye. 
HOMER 
(TOUCHED) You were? Oh well, go 
ahead. 
The fight starts again. 
BART 


You love him more! 


LISA 
No, you do! 

BART 
No, I don't! 

LISA 
Yes, you do! 

BART 
No, I don't! 

LISA 
Yes, you do! 

BART 


No, I don't! 


Final Deliery - 7/21/89 - Page 3. 


HOMER 
(ANGRY) Look, you better get this all 
out of your system right now. I don't 
want you two embarrassing me at the 
company picnic. 
Homer stomps off to the kitchen. 
INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS 


We are CLOSEUP on Homer. His face is grossly distorted as 
he looks through a huge gelatin mold. 


We PAN with Homer as he examines each of the other molds, 
seeing his face in each one. SFX: WOBBLING NOISES. He 
finally sees a marshmallow in one of the molds. 
HOMER 
Mmmm! Ooo! Mmmm! Marshmallow! 
He jams his arm up to the elbow into the mold and fishes 
out a marshmallow. He looks around. MARGE enters and sees 
the whole thing. 
MARGE 
(FIRMLY) Homer, what are you doing? 
Homer pops the marshmallow in his mouth, then BELCHES. 
MARGE (CONT'D) 
Homer! 
HOMER 
I'm trying to get at least some of the 
unfortunate noises out of my system 
while I can, Marge. I don't want to 
embarrass myself at the company picnic. 


MARGE 


(MURMUR OF ASSENT) 


Final Deliery - 7/21/89 - Page 4. 


HOMER 
(INDICATING GELATIN) Are you sure 
that's enough? You know how the boss 
loves your delicious gelatin desserts. 
MARGE 
(FLATTERED) Oh, Homer, Mr. Burns just 
said he liked it. Once. 
HOMER 
Marge, that's the only time he's ever 
spoken to me without using the word 
"bonehead." 
EXT. A BUMPY DIRT ROAD - THAT AFTERNOON 


The Simpsons' car bumps along the road leading to the 
boss's house. 


INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS 
The Simpsons all sit inside, each one holding a different- 
colored gelatin mold in his or her lap (including Maggie 
and Homer at the wheel). With every bump in the road, the 
gelatins quiver in unison. Homer points. 
HOMER 
There it is, kids... Stately Burns 
Manor. 
EXT. MR. BURNS' HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 
It is a huge mansion on a well-manicured estate with 
fountains and hedges--it looks like Tara. A sign reads: 
“Poachers Will Be Shot." Another sign reads: "Forget The 
Dog, Beware Of Owner." 
HOMER (CONT'D) 
Okay, now look. My boss is going to be 
at this picnic, so I want you to show 


your father some love and/or respect. 


Final Deliery - 7/21/89 - Page 5. 


LISA 
Tough choice. 
BART 
(GRUMBLES) Yeah. I guess ['ll 
respect the old doofus. 
EXT. MR. BURNS' HOUSE - A LITTLE LATER 
MR. BURNS greets his employees at the front door. SMITHERS 
stands beside him. The Simpsons stand in line behind 
Mr. and MRS. GAMMILL and their son TOM. 
BURNS 
Good to see you. Glad you could make 
it. 
MR. GAMMILL 
Oh, thank you, Mr. Burns. I'm so glad 
you invited us. 
TOM 
Not me. I had to miss little league 
for this. 
MR. GAMMILL 
Quiet, Tom. 
BURNS 
Oh, please, please, don't fight. Just 
go out back and have a good time. 


The Gammills enter the party. Burns, suddenly cold, turns 
to Smithers. 


BURNS (CONT'D) 
Fire that man, Smithers. I don't want 
him or his unpleasant family to ruin my 


picnic. 


Final Deliery - 7/21/89 


SMITHERS 

He'll be gone by the Tug-of-War, sir. 
BURNS 

Excellent! 

Homer GULPS as he steps up to shake the boss's hand. 

HOMER 

Afternoon, Mr. Burns. 
BURNS 

Ah! Hello, there, uh... wh... 
HOMER 

(WHISPERS) Simpson. Homer. 
SMITHERS 

There you go, Sir. 
BURNS 

Oh yes... Homer Simpson. 


Smithers rapidly shuffles through a stack of index cards 
and hands one to Burns. 


BURNS 
Oh, and this must be your lovely 
wife... (READING)... "Marge." Oh, 
oh...and look at little... (READING)... 
"Lisa". Why, she's growing like a 
weed. And this must be... (SQUINTING 
AT CARD)... "Brat". 

BART 


Bart.

Final Deliery - 7/21/89 - Page 7. 


HOMER 
Don't correct the man, Brat. (TO 
BURNS) Oh, Boss, look what we 
brought... gelatin desserts. 


The Simpsons all display their gelatin molds. Burns SMACKS 
his head in disgust. 


BURNS 
Oh, for the love of Peter! That's all 
anybody brought. Some damn fool went 
around telling everyone I love that 
slimy goop. Well, toss it in the pile 
over there. 
Burns indicates a long table laden with dozens of gelatin 
molds. S8FX: WOBBLING NOISES. Homer is chagrined. Over 
the following, the Simpsons enter and set their molds down. 
BURNS (CONT'D) 
And make yourselves at home. 
BART 
Hear that, Dad? You can lie around in 
your underwear and scratch yourself. 
HOMER 
Why, listen to me, you. 
Burns turns to see the disturbance. 
BURNS 
Trouble, Simpson? 
HOMER 
No, heh, heh. Just congratulating my 
son on a fine joke about his old man. 


Homer pats Bart on the head -- HARD. 


Final Deliery - 7/21/89 - Page 8. 


HOMER (CONT'D) 
Now, remember, as far as anyone knows, 
we're a nice, normal family. 
EXT. BURNS'S BACK YARD - A LITTLE LATER 
The Simpsons survey the huge back yard, filled with 
fountains and a small pool. We see FAMILIES enjoying the 
picnic. People are throwing frisbees, playing volleyball, 
eating picnic lunches. 
LISA 
(TO BART) Hey! Last one in the 
fountain is a rotten egg! 
Bart and Lisa run off. 
HOMER 
(SPUTTERING/GRUMBLING) Hey! You! Come 


back here, now... you... 


Homer takes off after them, leaving Marge alone with 
Maggie. MRS. LONG, carrying a cute INFANT, approaches. 


MARGE 
Oh, what an adorable little girl. 

MRS. LONG 
Thank you. (GAZING AT MAGGIE) Yours 
is... uh... thank you. Why don't we 
dump them in the nursery, and get a 
glass of punch? 

MARGE 
Oh, I'm not much of a drinker. 

MRS. LONG 
(POINTING 0.S.) Hey! Isn't that your 


boy there, torturing the swans? 


Final Deliery - 7/21/89 - Page 9, 


HOMER (0.S.) 

Bart! Bart! 

MARGE 

(ANNOYED MURMUR) No, and that isn't my 

husband chasing after him, either. 

Ummm... Maybe I'll take you up on that 

punch. 
INT. NURSERY - A LITTLE LATER 
Marge puts Maggie on the floor of the nursery -- the room 
is filled with BABIES, GIGGLING and LAUGHING and playing 
together. 


Mrs. Long puts her baby down and switches on the TV. The 
babies all stop playing and stare at the TV vacantly. 


EXT. BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS 
Homer walks around the backyard looking for Bart. 
HOMER 
Bart! Lisa! Bart! Lisa! 
Homer passes one of the outdoor fountains. Lisa, 
frolicking in the fountain, assumes a statue-like pose. 
Several SWANS come running through frame, HONKING in panic. 
HOMER 
Where are you, kids? 
Homer gets hit in the head with a rock. He GRUNTS in pain. 
BART 
Ooops! 
HOMER 
Gotcha! 


Homer grabs Bart. 


Final Deliery - 7/21/89 - Page 10. 


BART 
Careful, Dad. Blow a gasket and you 
lose your job. 


Homer puts Bart down gently and looks around to see if 
anyone's noticed. 


HOMER 
(GENTLY) Thanks, son. You saved me 
from making a terrible mistake. 

SMITHERS 
(THRU LOUDSPEAKER) Now hear this! Now 
hear this! The father-son sack race 
will begin in five minutes on the north 
lawn. Participation is mandatory; 
repeat, mandatory. That is all. 

HOMER 
(GRUMBLES) You remember the rules from 
last year? 

BART 
Yeah. Shut my mouth and let your boss 
win. 


Homer and Bart exit. A couple of swans poke their head out 
of bushes and look around. 


EXT. BACKYARD - PUNCHBOWL AREA ~ CONTINUOUS 
Marge drinks punch with several of the other WIVES. They 


also have big hairdos, but not as big as Marge's. Marge 
tosses back a glass of punch. 


Final Deliery - 7/21/89 - Page 11. 


WIFE #1 
I don't know who to love more. My son 
Joshua, who is captain of the football 
team, or my daughter Amber, who got the 
lead in the school play. Usually I use 
their grades as a tie-breaker, but they 
both got straight A's this term, so 


what's a mother to do? 


MARGE 
Well, uh... I sense greatness in my 
family. 

WIFE #2 
Your family? 

MARGE 


Well, it's a greatness that others 

can't see, but it's there and if it's 

not true greatness we have, we're at 

least average. (FINISHES DRINK; 

TIPSILY) I don't want to alarm anyone, 

but I think there's a li'l al-key-hol 

in this punch. 
EXT. BACK YARD - A LITTLE LATER 
Bart, Homer, and other FATHERS and SONS stand in potato 
sacks. It is the beginning of the race. Smithers raises 
the starting pistol above his head as the CONTESTANTS 
crouch in anticipation. 


SMITHERS 


Mr. Burns, are you ready? 


Final Deliery - 7/21/89 - Page 12. 


BURNS 
Yes. 

SMITHERS 
Are you set? 

BURNS 
Yes. 

SMITHERS 


(WHISPERS) Go, Mr. Burns. 
Burns leaves ahead of everyone else. Beat later, Smithers 
FIRES the GUN. Burns, in front, takes a hop and GRUNTS. 
The rest of the contestants take a hop, making sure to stay 
behind him. Burns takes another hop. The rest take 
another hop, staying behind the boss. 
BART 
(LOUDLY) Beep, beep, comin' through! 


Bart starts hopping ahead at top speed, passing Mr. Burns. 
Homer notes this with wide-eyed horror. 


HOMER 
Bart! No! 
Bart nears the finish line when Homer hops up behind him 
and tackles the boy. Bart GRUNTS. Slowly, Mr. Burns hops 
ahead to win the race. Onlookers CHEER. 


BURNS

EXT. BACK YARD - PUNCHBOWL AREA = CONTINUOUS 


Marge continues to drink with the other women. They are 
all SINGING.

shade.

Hey brother, pour the wine.

Homer approaches up, dragging Bart and Lisa. 


LISA 


Uh oh. Mom's on a bender. 


(URGENT) 


HOMER 


Snap out of it, Marge. 


You've got to come with me--the boss is 


going to 


(SLOSHED) 


make a toast! 
MARGE 


I'm not much of a drinker... 


She knocks back another drink. 


Final Deliery - 7/21/89 - Page 14. 


“HOMER 
Well, you picked a perfect time to 
start. (GRUMBLES) 
MARGE 
Right now you look so cute, Homie. 
Like a sad little puppy. Yes you do! 
Yum...yum...yum...yum...yum,. 


She puts her arms around his neck, kisses him, and nibbles 
his ear. 


HOMER 

Save it for the boudoir, Marge. 
He starts to exit, with Marge clinging to his neck. Marge 
is dragged along, leaving furrows in the ground as she 
goes. The kids follow. 
EXT. BACK YARD - ANOTHER AREA - SUNSET 
The Simpsons and the other families are assembled to hear 
Mr. Burns's toast. In the valley off in the distance, we 
see the sun setting over the nuclear power plant. Ona 
table is a cake shaped like the power plant. Burns holds 
up a glass. Smithers hands him some index cards. 


A BAND finishes PLAYING "The Bear Comes Over The Mountain" 
before Mr. Burns speaks. 


BURNS 
(READING) "Thank you all..." 
(NEXT CARD) "...for coming." 


The AUDIENCE APPLAUDS, and then they stop. Marge continues 
to APPLAUD and WHISTLE. 


HOMER 
(TEETH CLENCHED) Marge, knock it off! 
MARGE 


Whoops. I'm sorry. Sorry. Sorry. 


Final Deliery - 7/21/89 - Page 15. 


HOMER 
Marge! 

BURNS 
(READING) But now it's time to say 
goodbye. Please get off my property 
until next year. I suggest you don't 
dawdle. The hounds will be released in 
ten minutes. 


The workers APPLAUD. A NICE BOY and GIRL beam at their 
NICE FATHER. 


NICE FATHER 

Did you have a good time, son? 
NICE BOY 

Yeah, thanks, Pop. 


He kisses his father on the cheek. Burns and Smithers walk 
past. 


BURNS 
Awww. That's the kind of family unity 
I like to see. Smithers... 
SMITHERS 
Yes sir. 
BURNS 
Get that man's name. I predict big 
things for him. 
Homer overhears. 
HOMER 


(SOTTO) Quick, Bart, give me a kiss. 


Final Deliery - 7/21/89 - Page 16. 


BART 

Kiss you? But, Dad, I'm your kid! 
HOMER 

Bart, please. Five bucks for a kiss. 


Bart immediately jumps on Homer, embracing him and kissing 
him all over his forehead. 


BURNS 
(CONTEMPTUOUS GRUNT) I've never seen 
such an obvious attempt to curry my 
favor. 
SMITHERS 
Fabulous observation, sir. Just 
fabulous. 
cuT TO: 
EXT. DIRT ROAD - A LITTLE LATER 
The Simpsons arrive back at their car. Lisa is carrying 
Maggie as Marge tipsily prances along HUMMING. Ahead of 
them, the Nice Family is getting in their car, which is 
parked right in front of the Simpsons'. Homer turns to the 
Nice Father. 
HOMER 
Boy, I'm glad that's over. Now we can 
go home and act normal again. 
NICE FATHER 
What do you mean? 
HOMER 
Oh come on. That cornball routine. 
(MAKES KISSING NOISES; SARCASTIC) “I 


love you, Daddy." Give me a break. 


Final Deliery - 7/21/89 - Page 17. 


NICE FATHER 
I pity you. 
HOMER 
Why? 
Nice father walks to his car. Homer looks on, confused. 
HOMER'S P.O.V. - NICE FAMILY'S CAR 
The Nice Boy holds the car door open for the Nice Girl. 
NICE BOY 
After you. 
NICE GIRL 
Thank you so much. 
HOMER'S P.O.V. - SIMPSONS' CAR 


Lisa and Bart fight to get inside. 


LISA 
Me first! 

BART 
No, me! 

LISA 
No, me. 

BART 
No, me. 

LISA 
No, me. 

BART 
Me. 

LISA 


Me. 


Final Deliery - 7/21/89 - Page 18, 


Bart gets in. Lisa pulls him out onto the ground, and 
jumps in. 


ON NICE FAMILY'S CAR 


Nice Mother JINGLES the car keys and smiles sweetly at her 
husband. 


NICE MOTHER 
Honey, you look tired. Would you like 
me to drive? 
ON SIMPSONS' CAR 
Marge hangs her head out the passenger seat window. 
MARGE 
(MOANING) Ohhh, Homie. I think I'm 
going to be sick. 
ON NICE PAMILY'S CAR 
The car is shiny and white. The family members are all now 
dressed like angels, in white robes, wings and halos. The 
CAR STARTS and DRIVES OFF. 
NICE FAMILY 
(SINGING) There was a farmer had a 
dog. And Bingo was his name, oh... 
The car takes off into the sky. 
NICE FAMILY (CONT'D) 
(SINGING) B-I-N-G-0, B-I-N-G-O, 
-I-N-G-O. And Bingo was his name! 
oh! 
ON SIMPSONS! CAR 


It is red and flaming, and Homer's wife and kids are now 
demonic-looking. 


MARGE 


Homie, get in the car. 


Final Deliery - 7/21/89 - Page 19. 


LISA 
This is where you belong. 
BART 
Yeah, Homer. Room for one more. 
NICE FAMILY 
(SINGING) B-I-N-G-O, B-I-N-G-0, B-I-N- 
G-O. And Bingo was his name! Oh! 
MARGE/LISA/BART 
(CHANTS) One of us! One of us! 
One of us! One of us! 
EXT. ROAD 
Homer is behind the wheel of the car, wide-eyed and numb. 
The family CACKLES DEMONICALLY. The road is descending into 
Hell. Homer looks back at the Nice Family car, which has 
now almost disappeared into the clouds. Homer shudders and 


MOANS.

INT. SIMPSON LIVING ROOM - THAT EVENING 


Marge lies on the couch. The family is watching television 
and eating TV dinners. Homer enters carrying a plate. 


MARGE 

Homer, you're blocking the view. 
BART/LISA 

Hey! 

Homer CLICKS TV off. 

HOMER 

Now there's nothing to see. 
LISA 


That's for sure. 


Final Delivery - 7/21/89 - Page 21 


HOMER 

Look everybody, yesterday was a real 
eye-opener. We've got to do better as 
a family. So tonight we're not going 
to shovel food in our mouths while we 
stare at the TV. We're going to eat at 
the dining room table like a normal 
family. 

INT. SIMPSON DINING ROOM - A LITTLE LATER 


The Simpsons are seated at the table. 


LISA 
Happy, Dad? 

HOMER 
Yes. 

LISA 


Good. Commence shovelling. 
HOMER 
No. We're going to say grace first. 
BART 
Okay. Rub a dub dub, thanks for the 
grub. 


Final Delivery - 7/21/89 - Page 22. 


HOMER 
No! Ignore the boy, Lord. Now can the 
chatter and bow your heads. (CLEARS 
THROAT) Dear Lord, thank you for this 
microwaved bounty, even though we don't 
deserve it. I mean, our kids are 
uncontrollable hellions... pardon my 
French... but they act like savages! 
Did you see them at the picnic? of 
course you did. You're everywhere. 
You're omniverous. Oh, Lord, why did 
you smite me with this family? 

REST OF FAMILY 
Amen. Let's eat. 

They start shovelling down the food. 

HOMER 
No! I'm not done yet. 

MARGE 
But Homer, how long are we supposed 
to sit here and listen to you badmouth 
us to the Man upstairs? 

HOMER 
I'm sorry, Marge, but sometimes I think 
we're the worst family in town. 

MARGE 
Maybe we should move to a larger 


community. 


Final Delivery - 7/21/89 - Page 23. 


Homer GRUNTS. 
BART 
Don't have a cow, Dad. 
LISA 
The sad truth is all families are like 
us. 
HOMER 
You think so, huh? Well, there's only 
one way to find out. Follow me. 
EXT. NEIGHBOR #1'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
The Simpsons stand on a neighbor's front lawn, peering in 
the dining room window. Marge holds Maggie up so she can 
look. The Simpsons are amazed by what they see. Inside 
is a Norman Rockwell scene. A polite, well-dressed FAMILY 
enjoys a turkey dinner. 
HOMER 
(WHISPERS) Look at that, kids! No 
fighting, no yelling... 
BART 
(WHISPERS) No belching. 
LISA 
(WHISPERS) The dad has a shirt on. 
MARGE 
(WHISPERS) Look, napkins. 
Maggie reaches out to join that family. 
MARGE 


Sorry, honey. You belong to us. 


Final Delivery - 7/21/89 - Page 24. 


BART 
(REGULAR VOICE) These people are 
obviously freaks. 

HOMER 
(WHISPERS) Oh, you think so? Well, 
let's see what's behind Door Number 
Two. 


The Simpsons move as a group, with the background blurring 
behind them. SFX: MANY RAPID FOOTSTEPS. 


EXT. NEIGHBOR #2'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
The Simpsons stop short, taking an identical position at 
Neighbor #2's house. Inside the house, a MOTHER, a FATHER, 
and two KIDS are all sitting down, each reading a book. 
HOMER 
(WHISPERS) What are they doing? 


The Simpsons again move as a block on to the next house. 
SFX: MANY RAPID FOOTSTEPS. 


EXT. WILLIAMS' HOUSE - NIGHT 
The Simpsons step in front of the house. The WILLIAMSES 
are happily chatting in the den. Mr. Williams sits in an 
easy chair, holding a newspaper. We cannot hear them. 
MARGE 
(WHISPERS) They're having a 
conversation. They actually enjoy 
talking to each other. 
INT. WILLIAMS DEN - CONTINUOUS 
We hear what the Simpsons cannot. 
WILLIAMS BOY 
Papa, I believe I heard some rustling 


in the bushes. 


Final Delivery - 7/21/89 - Page 25. 


.MR. WILLIAMS 
I did too. Better get my gun. 
EXT. WILLIAMS! LAWN - CONTINUOUS 
The Simpsons look on, puzzled. 
LISA 
(WHISPERS) Where's he going? 
HOMER 
(WHISPERS) Probably to get the old man 
his pipe and slippers. 
Suddenly Mr. Williams is out on the porch, blasting away 
with his gun. SFX: GUNFIRE. The Simpsons run off HOWLING 
under a hail of bullets. 
EXT. ANOTHER HOUSE - A MINUTE LATER 


The Simpsons lean against the house, catching their breath. 
Bart peers in the window. 


BART 
(OUT OF BREATH, WHISPERS) Whoa, look 
at this place. What a dump. 

HOMER 
(OUT OF BREATH, WHISPERS) Hey, it's 
worse than you think. (CHUCKLING) I 
just trampled these poor saps' flower 
bed. 

MARGE 
Homer, this is our house. 

HOMER 
(GRUNTS IN EXASPERATION) 


Marge, Lisa, Bart and Maggie start to head inside. 


Final Delivery - 7/21/89 - Page 26. 


MARGE 
Are you coming in, Homer? 
HOMER 
No, no. (SIGHS) I want to be alone 
with my thought. 
PAN WITH HOMER 


As he walks down the street, he passes by many houses. 
Silhouetted in each window is a happy family scene. 


INT. MOE'S BAR - NIGHT 


The BARFLIES YELL and CHEER at a bloody boxing match on the 
wide-screen TV. Homer stands at the bar, glun. 


HOMER 
(SAD) Another beer, Moe. 

MOE 
What's the matter, Homer? Bloodiest 
fight of the year, and you're sitting 


there like a thirsty bump on a log. 


LOU, a black cop, and EDDIE, his white partner, enter with 
their police dog, BOBO. 


EDDIE 
Evening, Moe. 
MOE 
Eddie, want some pretzels? 
EDDIE 
No, thanks. We're on duty. Couple 
beers would be nice, though. 


Moe gets them two beers. Dog strains at his leash, 
sniffing Homer.

MOE 
That'll be two bucks, boys. Just 
kidding! 
LOU 
Oh, good one, Moe. Hey listen, we're 
looking for a family of Peeping Toms 
that has been terrorizing the 
neighborhood. 
Homer reacts. Dog WHIMPERS at Homer. 
LOU (CONT'D) 
(TO DOG) Quiet, boy. Let the nice 
people enjoy their beers. 
EDDIE 
The leader is a male Caucasian, with 
coarse, almost ape-like features. 
Lou 
You seen anyone fitting that 
description? 
We PAN THROUGH BAR. EVERYONE fits the description. 
MOE 
Not lately. 
LOU 
Don't worry. This dog has the scent. 
I think we'll be able to track him 
down. 


Starts to pull dog away from Homer but dog refuses to 
leave. Dog BARKS at Homer.

EDDIE 
Hey! What's gotten into Bobo? 
HOMER 
I've got some weiners in my pocket. 
EDDIE 
Figures. Come on, you stupid dog. 
Cops exit with dog. 
HOMER 
You know, Moe, my Mom once said 
something that really stuck with me. 
She said, “Homer, you're a big 
disappointment," and, God bless her 
soul, she was really onto something. 
BARNEY 
Don't blame yourself, Homer. You got 
dealt a bad hand. You got crummy 
little kids that nobody can control. 
HOMER 
You can't talk that way about my kids. 
Or, at least two of then. 
BARNEY 
Why? You got two I haven't met? 
HOMER 
Why, you... Here's five you haven't 
met. 


Homer PUNCHES Barney. They begin fighting. Not caring, 
Moe goes about his business, polishing glasses. 


Final Delivery - 7/21/89 - Page 29. 


MOE 

(QUIETLY) Break it up, boys. Take it 

easy. Settle down there. Not in my 

Place...settle down.... 
WIDEN to see that the barflies are ignoring Homer's fight, 
to watch the boxing match on TV. The bout is, punch-for- 
punch, exactly the same as Homer's fight. On TV one BOXER 
throws an uppercut, knocking out his OPPONENT, as Barney 
simultaneously knocks out Homer with an uppercut. 

BOXING ANNOUNCER (V.0O.) 

.-. And a right to the jaw... a left 

to the breadbasket! What a fight! 

How are these two proud gladiators 

still on their feet? They have heart 

and guts and intestines and spleen! 

Look at them moving, ducking, jabbing, 

dancing, counter-punching! Ladies and 

gentle- men, this is the sweet science 

at its finest! Oh! And a tremendous 

right! That's got to hurt! Ladies and

TV-STATION ANNOUNCER (V.O.) 
(FROM TV) All-Star Boxing is brought 
to you by "Dr. Marvin Monroe's Family 
Therapy Center". We want to be your 
family's fight doctor. 
A commercial comes on. Moe starts to make an elaborate 
cocktail, pouring in various liquors, mixing them in a 
shaker and adding a cherry. Moe then leans over the bar, 
and pours the mixture onto the face of the unconscious 
Homer, who lies on the floor. 
HOMER 
(COMING TO) Huh... what? 
Homer staggers to his feet to watch a commercial. On TV we 
see a CLOSEUP of a HUSBAND and WIFE in bed. (The following 
plays like a Schick Center alcohol treatment ad.) 
ON TV 
TV WIFE 
(FROM TV) Honey, aren't you going to 
work today? 
TV HUSBAND 
(FROM TV) No, I don't think so. 
TV WIFE 
(PROM TV) Honey, you have a problem. 
And it won't get better till you admit 
it. 
TV HUSBAND 
(FROM TV) I admit this: You better 
shut your big yap. 
TV WIFE

The overweight DR. MARVIN MONROE at his desk. 
DR. MONROE 
(FROM TV) Hi, friends. I'm Dr. Marvin

Homer still on floor. 
HOMER 
When will I learn? The answers to 
life's problems aren't at the bottom 
of a bottle. They're on TV! 


Moe drops the phone next to Homer. The receiver bounces 
out. Homer begins dialing as we:

FADE IN: 
INT. SIMPSON LIVING ROOM - THE NEXT DAY 


Marge, Lisa, Bart and Maggie are watching ITCHY and 
SCRATCHY on television. Homer enters. 


HOMER 

All right, time for a family meeting! 
He shuts off the Tv. 

BART 
(MOANS) 

LISA 
Why can't we have a meeting when you're 
watching TV? 

HOMER 
Now, look, you know and I know that 
this family needs help. Professional 
help. So I made us an appointment with 
Dr. Marvin Monroe. 

BART 


The fat guy on TV? 


Final Delivery - 7/21/89 - Page 34. 


LISA 
You're sending us to a doctor who 
advertises on pro wrestling? 
HOMER 
Boxing, Lisa, boxing. There's a world 
of difference. 
MARGE 
Gee, Homer, are you sure this is the 
right thing to do? 
HOMER 
Honey, I've given this matter a lot of 
study. And of all the commercials I 
saw, his was the best. (BEAT) All it 
costs is two hundred and fifty dollars. 
MARGE 
But we don't have that kind of money. 
HOMER 
Well, then, we're just going to have to 
dig deep. Marge, go get the kids’ 
college fund. 
MARGE 
Oh, Homer. 
HOMER 
Oh, come on, Marge. Why scrimp now on 
the off-chance that they'll actually 


get in someplace? 


Final Delivery - 7/21/89 - Page 35. 


CLOSEUP - COFFEE TABLE - LITTLE LATER 


Money is piled on it. PULL BACK to see the Simpsons, 
gathered round. Marge is counting the pennies. 


MARGE 
...forty-eight, forty-nine, fifty. 
Eighty-eight dollars and fifty cents. 
HOMER 
That's it? That's the college fund 
we've been saving all these years? 
LISA 
I guess I'd have needed a partial 
scholarship. 
HOMER 
Well, we're not licked yet. To save 
this family, we're all going to make 


the supreme sacrifice. 


EXT PAWN SHOP - LATER 


WE SEE a prominent "PAWN SHOP" sign. Homer approaches, 
GRUNTING, carrying the TV. His family follows, clearly 


upset. 


LISA 


No, Dad! Please don't pawn the Tv! 


MARGE 
Homer, couldn't we pawn my engagement 


ring instead? 


Final Delivery - 7/21/89 - Page 36. 


HOMER 
Now, I appreciate that, honey, but we 
need one hundred and fifty dollars 
here. 
Homer goes inside. 
INT. PAWN SHOP - CONTINUOUS 


Homer approaches the PAWN BROKER'S cage and sets the TV 
down in front of it. 


PAWN BROKER 
Afternoon, Simpson. You here to pick 
up Bart's archery set? 


He indicates a bow and arrow, propped beside a target with 
Homer's picture stuck on it. 


HOMER 
Lord, no! 
PAWN BROKER 
How about Bart's drum set? 
HOMER 
(SHUDDERS) Not today. 
PAWN BROKER 
Perhaps Bart's BB gun? 
HOMER 
Are you out of your mind? 
PAWN BROKER 


So what can I do for you? 


Final Delivery - 7/21/89 - Page 37. 


HOMER * 
(HOLDING UP TV) Would you pay one 
hundred fifty dollars for this lovely 
Motorola? 
PAWN BROKER 
Is it cable-ready? 
HOMER 
(COVERING) Ready as she'll ever be! 
PAWN BROKER 
Mister, you got yourself a deal. 
Pawn Broker hands Homer the money. 
INT. FAMILY THERAPY CENTER - WAITING ROOM - DAY 
The Simpsons enter to see other families in need of 
therapy. There is a SKINHEAD family, including a SKINHEAD 
BABY. They're all GROWLING. Another grim FAMILY OF FOUR 
sits in a row, each wearing an "I'M WITH STUPID" t-shirt 
that points to the next family member. They're shoving 
each other. A third family is in a group wrestle hold. 
MARGE 
(SNIFFLES) 
HOMER 
Marge, what's wrong? 
MARGE 
All our money, the college funds, the 
TV. Homer, you're driving a stake 
through the hearts of those who love 
you. 
HOMER 
Hey, no pain, no gain. 


Homer reaches the RECEPTIONIST'S window. 


Final Delivery - 7/21/89 - Page 38. 


Please sign here. (AS HOMER SIGNS 
IN). Will you be paying by cash or 
check? 
HOMER 
(PROUDLY) Cash, of course. I've got 
two hundred and fifty dollars right 
here with me. I'm holding it right 
now. Here it is. Look. Check it out. 
Two hundred and fifty big ones. 
CLOSEUP - HOMER'S sweaty hand holding the money. 
BART 
If you really want to impress her, show 
her the big empty space where our TV 
used to be. 
HOMER 
Bart! 


Homer hands the money to the Receptionist. 


Suddenly the door by the Receptionist opens. A family 
greatly resembling the Simpsons emerges--a HOMER-ISH 
HUSBAND, a MARGE-ISH WIFE, a BART-LIKE BOY, a LISA-LIKE 
GIRL and a MAGGIE-LIKE BABY. They are all hugs and smiles 
as they cross the room. 
HOMER-ISH HUSBAND 

Come on, family. Let's go celebrate 

our new-found ability to express love 

for each other. I'm taking you out for 

frosty chocolate milkshakes. 


The Boy and Girl CHEER. 


Final Delivery - 7/21/89 - Page 39. 


MARGE-ISH WIFE 
(TO HUSBAND) Oh, I love you, Gomer. 
LISA 
There go my young-girl dreams of 
Vassar. 


She gives him a peck on the cheek and they exit. The 
Simpsons stare at them in amazement. A buzzer BU2ZES8. 


RECEPTIONIST 
Simpson, family of five. The doctor 
will see you now. 
The Simpsons snap out of it and head for the door. 
INT. DR. MONROE'S OFFICE - A LITTLE LATER 
The Simpsons are seated in Dr. Marvin Monroe's office. The 
doctor is handing them each a pad of paper and a large 
felt-tip marker. 
DR. MONROE 
Hello, I'm Dr. Marvin Monroe. No doubt 
you recognize me from TV. 
LISA 
We would if we had one. 
HOMER 


Lisa! 


Final Delivery - 7/21/89 - Page 40. 


DR. MONROE 
No, No, Homer, don't stifle the 
youngster. Your family must feel free 
to express itself. That's what these 
pads and jumbo markers are for. I want 
you to draw for me your fears, your 
anxieties, the roots of your 
unhappiness. Now take a deep, 
cleansing breath, and begin. 
The Simpsons INHALE, EXHALE and start drawing. Marge, Lisa 
and Bart soon flip over their pads to show the Doctor. 
They have each drawn a portrait of Homer. 
DR. MONROE (CONT'D) 
No surprises here. Homer? 
Homer himself is still working hard at his drawing--sweat 
flying out of his head, and his tongue sticking out of the 
corner of his mouth. 
HOMER 
(HUMS ) 
DR. MONROE 


Homer, what have you got for us? 


Homer holds up a picture of a jet plane firing bullets--it 
looks like a drawing a seventh-grader might do. 


DR. MONROE 
Homer! 
HOMER 
Whoops. Sorry, I wasn't paying 


attention. 


Final Delivery - 7/21/89 - Page 41. 


DR. MONROE 
Well, if you had been paying attention, 
perhaps you would have noticed that 
your family sees you as a rather stern 
authority figure - an ogre, if you 
will. 

MARGE 
Now, Doctor, that's not true. 

LISA 
"Ogre" is such a strong word. 

BART 
Right on, Doc. Another successful 
diagnosis. 

HOMER 
So you think I'm an ogre, huh. That 
does it. 


Homer GROWLS. He picks up a lamp to throw at Bart. 
Dr. Monroe holds up his hand. 


DR. MONROE 
Wow! (PAUSE) Okay, you want to kill 
each other. That's good. That's 
healthy. There's nothing necessarily 
wrong with hostile conflict. All I ask 
is that you use my patented aggression 
therapy mallets. 

HOMER 


Good idea. 


Final Delivery - 7/21/89 - Page 42. 


All right! 
MARGE 
(TROUBLED) I don't know... 
Dr. Monroe substitutes a padded baton for the lamp in 
Homer's hands. He gives batons to Bart, Lisa, Marge and 
Maggie. 
DR. MONROE 
Okay, let's take another deep, 


cleansing breath. 


The Simpsons INHALE, then start WHACKING each other with 
batons. SFX: WHOMP. WHOMP. After a beat, they stop. 


HOMER 
Wait a minute. These mallet things are 
padded with foam rubber. What's the 
point? 
Bart slides the foam rubber covering off his baton. 
BART 
They'd work much better without the 
padding, doc. 
DR. MONROE 
No, no. That's not true. 
BART 
Oh sure it is. Look, see. 
He WHACKS the Doctor in the shins. 
DR. MONROE 
Ow! 


Bart tries to whack Dr. Monroe again, but the Doctor grabs 
the paddle. 


Final Delivery - 7/21/89 - Page 43. 


DR. MONROE 
(MAD) Yes, well, that concludes this 
portion of our treatment. 
MARGE 
Are we cured yet? 
DR. MONROE 
Don't be ridiculous. You will be 
cured, but it's going to require 
somewhat more unorthodox methods. 
HOMER 
Unortho what? 
DR. MONROE 
Don't worry, I'll have plenty of time 
to explain while I warm up the electric 
generator. 
INT. DR. MONROE'S LABORATORY - A LITTLE LATER 


The Simpsons are seated in a stark white laboratory. They 


are all wired with electrodes... each has a bank of buttons 
in front of them. It looks like A Clockwork Orange. 
DR. MONROE 


Everyone comfy? Good. Now, don't 
touch any of those buttons in front of 
you, for a very important reason, i.e. 
you are wired in to the rest of your 
family. You have the ability to shock 
them, and they have the ability to 
shock-- 


Bart hits a button and Homer is electrocuted. SFX: BZZ23. 


Final Delivery - 7/21/89 - Page 44. 


HOMER 
Arrrgh! 
BART 
Just testing. 
Homer reaches for his button. Dr. Monroe grabs his hand. 
DR. MONROE 
No, Homer! Not yet! You see, this is 
what is known as aversion therapy. 
When someone hurts you emotionally, you 
will hurt them physically, and 
gradually you will learn not to hurt 
each other at all. And won't that be 
wonderful, Homer? 
HOMER 
(SEEMINGLY MOVED) Oh, yes, doctor. 


Dr. Monroe lets go of Homer's hand. Homer hits a button, 
and Bart is ZAPPED. 


BART 
Arrrgh! 
Bart hits a button, and Lisa is ZAPPED. 
LISA 
Arrrgh! 
MARGE 
Bart, how could you shock your little 
sister? 
BART 


My finger slipped.

BART 
Arrrgh! 

LISA 
So did mine. 

MARGE 


Bart! Lisa! Stop that. 
Marge hits two buttons, ZAPPING Bart and Lisa. 
BART/LISA 
Arrrgh! 


Maggie is happily and randomly pressing on her buttons over 
and over. 


HOMER 
Arrrgh! 

LISA 
Arrrgh! 

MARGE 
Arrrgh! 

BART 
Arrrgh! 


INT. WAITING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
The YOWLS of the Simpson family can be heard clearly in the 
waiting room. The lights in the room dim repeatedly, each 
time a Simpson gets the juice. The Receptionist and the 
three families in need of therapy look scared. 
SKINHEAD DAD 
This place is too weird for me. 


The Skinhead family gets up and heads for the exit.

The Simpsons are now ZAPPING each other with wild abandon-- 


at least three of them are being electrified at any one 
time. The room fills with smoke.

you! 

The Simpsons all stop their ZAPPING.

Hey, nice hair, Mom. 

MARGE 
Gee, I thought we were making real 
progress. 

DR. MONROE 
No, I'm sorry, you're not. Please, 
you've just got to go. 

HOMER 
Wait a minute, Doc. Your TV commercial 
said family bliss we get double your 
money back!

INT. WAITING ROOM - A LITTLE LATER 
The Simpsons are all hugs and smiles, resembling the 
Simpson-like Family that passed through earlier, except 
that the Simpsons are smoldering. Dr. Monroe is counting 
the money out to Homer.

(HANDING THE MONEY TO HOMER) twenty, 
forty, sixty, eighty, one; twenty, 
forty, sixty, eighty, two; twenty, 
forty, sixty, eighty, three; twenty, 
forty, sixty, eighty, four; twenty, 
forty, sixty, eighty, five hundred. 
Here, just go, and never tell anyone 


you were here. 


HOMER 

Wow! Five hundred smackers! 

The Simpsons exit. Homer holds up a big wad of bills.

HOMER 
Yeah...

Excuse me, dear. Shouldn't we be 
heading down to the pawn shop to get 
our TV back? 

HOMER 
That piece of junk? Forget it! We're 
going to get a new TV! Twenty-one-inch 
screen... realistic flesh tones... and 
a little cart so we can wheel it into 
the dining room on holidays! 

LISA/BART 
Yay! 

MARGE 
Oh, Homer... we love you. 


She gives him a peck on the cheek. Actual sparks fly as 
we: 


FADE OUT.

WHO SHOT MR. BURNS? (PART ONE) 
by 
Bill Oakley & Josh Weinstein 
ACT_ONE 
FADE IN: 
ESTABLISHING SHOT - ELEMENTARY SCHOOL = 7:00 A.M. 
INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS 
PRINCIPAL SKINNER strolls reflectively down the empty hall. 
SKINNER 
Ah, is there nothing so poetic as the 
school hallway at early morn? (BEAT) 
Linoleum, how you’1l squeak / With the 
sound of pupils’ eager feet. / Bulletin 
board, of trusty cork / Full of 
thumbtacks and A-plus work. 
He stops and makes a sour face as he SNIFFS something odd. 
SKINNER (CONT’D) 
Hmm. School normally doesn’t smell 
so... rank. 


He turns to make sure no one is watching, then SNIFFS his 
underarms. 


SKINNER (CONT’D) 
Ahh. Washbasin fresh. (LOOKS AROUND) 
That funk must be coming from one of 
the classrooms. 


Skinner takes out his huge key-ring and opens a classroom 
door. 


2F16 FINAL 1 9/9/94 Page 2. 


INT. SCHOOL - BART’S CLASSROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Skinner winces, covers his nose with a handkerchief, and 
peers into the gerbil cage. (NOTE: We don’t see what’s 
inside.) 
SKINNER 
(SIGH) Poor fellow. Crushed by his own 
water bottle... 
INT. SCHOOL - CUSTODIAN’S CLOSET - A LITTLE LATER 
GROUNDSKEEPER WILLIE sits on an overturned bucket, reading 
"Weekly Reader," and CHUCKLING. Skinner KNOCKS and enters, 
carrying a used box (labelled "Faculty Brand Coffee 
Substitute, 12 packets.") 
SKINNER 
Willie, sometime over the holiday 
weekend, the beloved Grade Four gerbil, 
er, Superdude, lost his life. I need 
you to air out the classroom and give 


Superdude a proper burial. 


He hands Willie the box, and we hear a small body roll 
around inside. 


GROUNDSKEEPER WILLIE 
(DISGUSTED GROAN) 
INT. SCHOOL - BASEMENT - LATER 


Willie digs a small grave in the dirt floor. The box sits 
nearby. 


GROUNDSKEEPER WILLIE 
(TO BOX) Yer lucky yer getting a decent 
burial! Me own father got thrown in 
the bog! 


When he lifts his shovel, he sees the tip is dripping with 
thick black liquid. 


2F16 FINAL 1 9/9/94 Page 


GROUNDSKEEPER WILLIE (CONT’D) 
What in the name of St. Ephesiocritus?! 
(EE-FEEZ-EE-OCK-RIT-US) 
Willie curiously TAPS the bottom of the hole with his 
shovel. The ground begins to RUMBLE ominously, and a 
network of cracks shoots through the dirt floor. Suddenly, 
a huge gusher of oil shoots out of the hole, spraying 
against the ceiling with tremendous force. Oil rains down 
everywhere. 
GROUNDSKEEPER WILLIE 
(YELLS) 
INT. SCHOOL - BART’S CLASSROOM - CONTINUOUS 
All the windows are open, and a large electric fan is 
blowing. MRS. KRABAPPEL holds her nose and sprays 
disinfectant around the empty gerbil cage. 
BART 
Yuck. What reeks? 
NELSON 
Smells like one of Van Houten’s! 
MILHOUSE 
It does not! 
The floor begins to TREMBLE. The kids exchange nervous 
glances, and a second later, the gusher rockets through the 
floor next to Bart’s desk and strains against the ceiling. 
INT. SCHOOL = LISA’S CLASSROOM - (UPSTAIRS) - CONTINUOUS 


The floor under Ralph’s desk begins PULSATING. He looks 
down, worried, then raises his hand. 


RALPH 

Miss Hoover? The floor is shaking. 
MISS HOOVER 

(SKEPTICAL) Ralph. Remember the time 


you thought the -- 


3. 


2F16 FINAL 1 9/9/94 Page 4. 


The gusher breaks through right under Ralph, and he’s 
thrown out of frame by an immense torrent of oil. 


RALPH 
(DOPPLER YELL) Mommmmy!!! 
EXT. SCHOOL - LONG SHOT - CONTINUOUS 
The gusher BURSTS through the school roof and shoots sixty 
feet into the air. Waves of oil pour down over the sides 
of the building. 
ESTABLISHING SHOT - POWER PLANT - MORNING 
INT. POWER PLANT - BOARD ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
MR. BURNS stands at the end of a long table of EXECUTIVES. 
BURNS 
Now, before we adjourn, gentlemen, I 
have one last matter of utmost 
importance. I need to send this parcel 
with the profit projections to Pete 
Porter in Pasadena - (OMINOUS) And it 
absolutely, positively has to be there 
overnight! 
He seals a distinctive red, white, and blue envelope and 
hands it to the nearest executive. Zany Federal Express 
commercial music begins PLAYING as each executive nervously 
passes the envelope to the next one. 
EXECUTIVE #1 
(FAST) Pete Porter. Pass it on. 
EXECUTIVE #2 
(FAST) Pasadena. Promptly. 
EXECUTIVE #3 
(FAST) Package for parcel processing. 


Pronto. 


2F16 FINAL 1 9/9/94 Page 5. 


He passes it to SMITHERS, who dashes out. 
INT. POWER PLANT - PARCEL PROCESSING - PRESENTLY 


Smithers hands the envelope to a fat man with a big 
handlebar moustache, who sits in an office full of papers. 


SMITHERS 
(FAST) Perk up, Prendergast. Profoundly 
pressing package of power plant profit 
projections for Pete Porter in 
Pasadena. 
PRENDERGAST 
(FAST) Priority? 
SMITHERS 
(FAST) Precisely. 
MONTAGE of Burns’ envelope being shuttled through various 
weird offices, SHOOTING through a pneumatic tube, and being 
passed along hand-to-hand as the MUSIC continues. Finally, 
a hand places the package in front of Homer. He picks it 
up, reads the shipping label, and runs out. 
INT. POWER PLANT - BURNS’ OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 
Homer BURSTS through the door, PANTING. 
HOMER 
(EAGER) Here’s your package, Mr. Burns! 
He proudly places it on Burns’ desk. The MUSIC stops. 
BURNS 
(LIVID SPUTTERING) My name is the 
return address, you senseless 


dunderpate! Smithers, who is this 


nincompoop? 


2F16 FINAL 1 9/9/94 Page 6. 


ANGLE ON HOMER 
HOMER’S BRAIN (V.0.) 
(SLIGHTLY HURT) I’ve worked here for 
ten years, and my boss doesn’t even 
know my name? (THEN RESOLUTE) Well, 
that’s gonna change right now. (LOUD) 
My name is Homer J. Simp-- 
Burns pushes a button on his desk. A moderately-sized 
weight falls from the ceiling, lightly THOCKS Homer’s head, 
and DROPS to the floor. The weight is marked "1000 grams." 
HOMER (CONT’D) 
(BARELY FAZED) --son! 
BURNS 
(RE: WEIGHT) Sounded large when I 
ordered it. (SIGH) I can’t make hide 
nor hair of these metric booby-traps. 
EXT. THE SCHOOL ROOF - LATER THAT DAY SCENE 2 


A distraught-looking Skinner peers down through the gaping 
three-story hole, all the way to the basement. 


SKINNER 
My Lord. Such destruction. 


SUPERINTENDENT CHALMERS climbs out of a trapdoor onto the 
school roof, fuming. 


SKINNER (CONT’D) 
Superintendent Chalmers! (NERVOUS) How 


are you going? 


2F16 FINAL 1 9/9/94 Page 7. 


SUPERINTENDENT CHALMERS 
Why is it when I heard the word 
"school" and the word "exploded," I 
immediately thought of the word 
"Skinner"? 
SKINNER 
I-I-I-I know my school has had more 
than its fair share of catastrophes... 
SUPERINTENDENT CHALMERS 
(COUNTING THEM OFF) Earwig 
infestations...Dogs in the vents... 
Students who emit poisonous fumes... 
SKINNER 
None of those were my fault, except for 
the earwigs. 
An ENGINEER emerges from the trapdoor with a beaker of oil. 
ENGINEER 
Congratulations, gentlemen. Your 
custodian struck oil. You’re standing 
on top of the richest elementary school 
in the state. 
Skinner and Chalmers look amazed and overjoyed. 
ENGINEER (CONT’D) 
We also found this. 


He produces an oil-covered, gerbil-shaped blob and hands it 
to Skinner. 


SKINNER 


(SOTTO) Thank you, Superdude. 


2F16 FINAL 1 9/9/94 Page 8. 


Skinner FLINGS Superdude over the side of the building. 
INT. POWER PLANT - PENTHOUSE - THE NEXT MORNING 
A plaque reads "EXECUTIVE SPA -- ‘Physical Fitness for 
Better Tyranny.’" Smithers and Burns, in matching 
sweatsuits, ride an exercycle built for two. Smithers does 
all the pedaling while Burns reads a newspaper. 
CLOSE-UP - NEWSPAPER 
The headline reads "AWFUL SCHOOL IS AWFUL RICH." 
BURNS 
(GRUNT) Bah! A non-profit organization 
with oil? (MIFFED) An oil well doesn’t 
belong in the hands of Betsy 
Bleedingheart and Maynard G. Muskie- 
vote! 
SMITHERS 
(OUT OF BREATH) Uh, Sir, have you had 
enough exercise for this morning? 
BURNS 
No. Let’s go another twenty miles. 
SMITHERS 
Ugh! 
Smithers GROANS and resumes. As he continues pedaling, 
Burns gets off the bike and wanders into another roon. 
After a beat, we hear the SOUND OF A PINBALL MACHINE. 
INT. POWER PLANT - ELEVATOR - A LITTLE LATER 
A few WORKERS are already in the elevator as Burns and 
Smithers enter in their sweatsuits. Burns greets LENNY, 
CARL and a THIRD EMPLOYEE, who is completely concealed 
inside a radiation suit. 


BURNS 


Hello, Lenny, Carl, Guillermo... 


2F16 FINAL 1 9/9/94 Page 9. 


He turns to the final employee, Homer, who is wearing a 
hardhat with "H. SIMPSON" stencilled on it and a name tag 
that says "HELLO! MY NAME IS HOMER SIMPSON." Homer smiles 
eagerly. 
BURNS (CONT’D) 
Hello... (CAN’T REMEMBER) Eh... 
do..er... uh... Oooh...umm... 


The elevator stops, and Burns and Smithers make a hasty 
exit. Homer looks upset. 


LENNY 
Don’t take it so hard, Homer. He’s 
always screwin’ up people’s names. 
GUILLERMO 
Yeah. At the picnic, he thought my son 
Reynaldo was my son Rolando. Can you 
believe that? 
INT. SCHOOL - PRINCIPAL’S OFFICE - LATER 
Chalmers walks around smoking a cigar. 
SKINNER 
Superintendent, we made the front page 
today! 


Skinner holds up the paper, sliding his hand over the 
headline so that it reads "SCHOOL IS AWFUL RICH!" 


SUPERINTENDENT CHALMERS 
Uh, what’s that say under your hand 
there? 

SKINNER 


Hm, it’s an unrelated article. 


2F16 FINAL 1 9/9/94 Page 10. 


SUPERINTENDENT CHALMERS 
It’s an unrelated article. Within the 
banner headline? 

SKINNER 
Yes. Now, to re-direct our 
conversation slightly, I had a few 
ideas on how to spend this oil money. 

SUPERINTENDENT CHALMERS 
Seymour, this school is going to be so 
rich, you’ll be able to give each 
student a full college scholarship! 

SKINNER / CHALMERS 
(UPROARIOUS LAUGHTER) 

SKINNER 
Oh mercy. Seriously though, before we 
draw up the budget, I believe the 
students and faculty have a few 
suggestions... 


MONTAGE of PEOPLE presenting their ideas. (At the end of 
each presentation, Skinner stamps the proposal "APPROVED.") 


1) Groundskeeper Willie wheels in a model of the school 
grounds, which features a G.I. Joe/Willie holding a leaf 
blower. 


2F16 FINAL 1 9/9/94 Page 11. 


GROUNDSKEEPER WILLIE 
I want the new leaf blower from the 
Sharper Image Custodial Catalog. It’s 
got a Rolls-Royce jet engine, and it/1l 
blow leaves 15,000 miles away. Let 
some groundskeeper in Armenia rake ‘em 
up! 
Willie SWITCHES on the little leaf blower. First, it BLOWS 
the little leaves away. Then it BLOWS the entire model out 
the window. 
GROUNDSKEEPER WILLIE (CONT’D) 
I’d also like to be reimbursed for the 
model. 
2) LUNCHLADY DORIS enters. 
LUNCHLADY DORIS 
The cafeteria staff is complaining 
about the mice in the kitchen. (BEAT) 
I want to hire a new staff. 
3) LISA enters. 
LISA 
I’d like to start a jazz program for 
the music department. We’ve got a 
really great instructor lined up... 
She opens the door, revealing a distinguished GENTLEMAN. 
SKINNER / CHALMERS 
(EXCITED) Tito Puente! 


Tito Puente PLAYS a short riff on his conga drum. 


2F16 FINAL 1 9/9/94 Page 


LISA 
He’s ready to give up the drudgery of 
the professional mambo circuit and 
settle into a nice teaching job. 

TITO PUENTE 
It will be my pleasure. Lisa has told 
me all your students are as bright and 
dedicated to jazz as she is. 

LISA 
(NERVOUS CHUCKLE, EYES DARTING) Let’s 
go now, Mr. Puente. 

TITO PUENTE 


Eh-eh... Never touch Tito. 


Lisa leads Tito Puente away. 


INT. SCHOOL - PRINCIPAL’S OFFICE - LATE SCENE 3 
THAT AFTERNOON 


Skinner is packing his briefcase to leave. A voice comes 
over his intercom. 


VOICE (SMITHERS) (0.S.) 
Principal Skinner, this is your 
secretary. There is one last student 
here to see you. 

SKINNER 
That’s odd. I don’t have a secretary, 


or an intercom. But send him in. 


Mr. Burns enters, wearing Jimbo Jones’ hat and skull T- 


shirt. 


12. 


2F16 FINAL 1 9/9/94 Page 13. 


BURNS 
Ahoy there, Dean! I understand you’re 
taking suggestions from students, eh? 
Well, me and my Fourth Form chums think 
it would be quite "corking" if you’d 
sign over your oil well to the local 
energy concern! 

SKINNER 
(CLEARS THROAT) Mr. Burns... 

BURNS 
(CAUGHT) Bheh! 

SKINNER 
It was naive of you to think I would 
mistake this town’s most prominent 104 
year-old man for one of my elementary 
school students. 

BURNS 
I want that oil well! I’ve gota 
monopoly to maintain! I own the 
Electric Company and the Waterworks, 
plus the hotel on Baltic Avenue. 

SKINNER 
That hotel’s a dump, and your monopoly 
is pathetic. The school’s oil well is 
not for sale. (BUILDING) Particularly 
to a black-hearted scoundrel like 


yourself! 


2F16 FINAL 1 9/9/94 Page 14. 


BURNS 
I see. Then I’1l just have to... AT- 
TTACK YOU! 


Burns lunges at Skinner, and they begin fighting. Burns 
flails feebly about, and Skinner fends him off with little 


difficulty. 
BURNS (CONT’D) 
(FIGHTING NOISES) Egh! Oogh! (PANTS) 
Smithers! Smithers, get in here with 
that blunt instrument! 
SMITHERS 
(ENTERING) Sorry, sir, this is all I 
could find! 
Smithers brandishes an open stapler and lamely fires 


staples at Skinner. Most of them fall to the ground before 
reaching hin. 


SMITHERS 
Take that! And that! 
BURNS 
Ugh. 
SMITHERS 
Ah. 
EXT. SCHOOL - FRONT STEPS - SECONDS LATER 


The doors fly open, and Skinner hurls Smithers and Burns 
down the steps. They lie sprawled on the ground, beaten. 


BURNS 
I’1l have that oil if it’s the last 


thing I do. 


2F16 FINAL 1 9/9/94 Page 15. 


SMITHERS 
Before you die, or before you lose 
consciousness, Sir? 
BURNS 
(WITH GREAT EFFORT) ...Eh, die. 
Burns passes out. 


FADE OUT: 


END OF ACT ONE 


2F16 FINAL 1 9/9/94 Page 16. 


AcT Two 
FADE IN: 
INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT SCENE 4 
The family is eating dinner. 
MARGE 
I’m happy for the school. It sounds 
like this money is gonna provide a lot 
of new opportunities. 
BART 
Big deal. They didn’t approve my idea. 
They said it was "unfeasible." 
LISA 
It is unfeasible to resurrect the dead, 
Bart. And even if the Three Stooges 
were alive, I doubt they’d want to hang 
around with you. 
BART 
(CONSIDERS THIS) Well, um, yeah. I 
guess they’d probably want to be with 
their families or something, huh? 
LISA 
I can’t wait to have jazz class with 
Tito Puente. 
MARGE 
Your father and I own all his albums, 
even "A Mambo Memorial for President 


Kennedy." 


2F16 FINAL 1 9/9/94 Page 17. 


Homer picks listlessly at his uneaten pork chops. 
HOMER 
(GLUM) Mambo. Blugh. 
LISA 
What’s the matter, Dad? You look 
different. 
She gestures to the "family portrait" (the one with Homer 
strangling Bart, etc.) with the Simpsons drawn in their 
1989 style. 
HOMER 
(BAD ANNOYED GRUNT) I hate my job. I 
mean, what’s the point when your boss 
doesn’t even remember your name? 
MARGE 
I have an idea. When my father was 
first trying to catch my mother’s eye, 
he sent her a box of candy with his 
photo in it. After that, she never 
forgot hin. 
HOMER 
That’s a great idea! 
Homer KISSES Marge and runs out. 
BART 
(SKEPTICAL) That is a joke, right? And 
what, then she thought your dad’s name 


was Whitman Sampler? 


2F16 FINAL 1 9/9/94 Page 18. 


MARGE 
No, she did not, Mr. Smartypants. 
(BEAT, THEN SHEEPISH) She thought his 
name was Russell Stover. 
INT. POWER PLANT - BURNS’ OFFICE = THE NEXT DAY 


Smithers and Burns stand on the balcony outside his office. 
Burns looks through binoculars. 


BINOCULAR POV 
WORKMEN put the finishing touches on a new oil derrick 
which towers above the school. (It rises through the big 
hole in the roof.) 
BURNS (V.0.) 
That’s it. Frimble about with your 
widgets and doobobs. It’ll all bea 
monument to futility when my plan comes 
to fruition. 
The binoculars swivel to look downtown, where a busy 
construction site has sprung up in a vacant lot next to 
Moe’s. The site is obscured by a tall barrier, on which is 
stencilled "BURNS CONSTRUCTION CO. -- BUILDING A BETTER 
TOMORROW -- FOR HIM." 
SMITHERS (V.0.) 
Sir... (CLEARS THROAT) What I’m about 
to say violates every sycophantic urge 
in my body, but: I wish you would 
reconsider. This isn’t a rival company 
you’re battling with. It’s a school. 
People won’t stand for it. 
BURNS 
Pish-posh. It will be like taking 


candy from a baby. 


2F16 FINAL 1 9/9/94 Page 


Through the binoculars, Burns sees a BABY sitting in a 
nearby yard eating a large candy cane. 


BURNS (CONT’D) 
Eh, say, that sounds like a larf. 
Let’s try it right now. 


Burns heads for the door. Smithers reluctantly follows, 
then spies a gift-wrapped box of candy on Burns’ desk. 


SMITHERS 
Ah, ub, there’s some candy right here, 
Sir. Why don’t we eat this instead of 
stealing? 
BURNS 
Oh, very well. 
Smithers opens the box, and the two begin hungrily snapping 
up the chocolates inside. As they eat, they start to 
uncover the Simpson family photo underneath the candy. 
BURNS/SMITHERS 
(EATING NOISES) 
SMITHERS 
Oh, look, there’s a photo in here. 
BURNS 
(CHEWING) Hmm, yes. I believe that’s 
little Maggie Simpson -- the baby who 
found my precious teddy-bear Bobo. Oh 
and there’s that, ah Simpson mutt, my 
former guard dog. 


They eat some more candy and uncover Bart’s face. 


19. 


2F16 FINAL 1 9/9/94 Page 20. 


BURNS (CONT’D) 
(STILL CHEWING) Ooh that’s uh, uh, Bart 
Simpson. He was my heir for a brief 
period, you know. 

SMITHERS 
Yes, Sir, I remember. 

DISSOLVE TO: 
FIFTEEN MINUTES LATER 


Burns and Smithers lounge around with bloated stomachs, 
dabbing chocolate off their faces. 


BURNS 
Anything left? 
SMITHERS 
Only the sour quince log, Sir. 
He holds out the box to Burns, and we see that the family 
is completely uncovered, except for a grotesque candy lump 
which obscures Homer’s entire face. 
BURNS 
(REPULSED SOUND) Dispose of it. 
(THOUGHTFUL) And uh, send a thank-you 
note to Marge, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie 
Simpson. 


Smithers dumps the box in the trash. The candy slowly 
slides away, smearing Homer’s face with chocolate. 


EXT. SCHOOL - A FEW DAYS LATER SCENE 5 


STUDENTS, TEACHERS, and REPORTERS are gathered around the 
front steps for the oil well’s opening ceremonies. The 
derrick is festooned with colorful bunting and a banner 
saying "3R’s OIL CORP.: READIN’, REFININ’ & REFORMATIVE 
POLYMERIZATIN’." 


A teacher 


2F16 FINAL 1 9/9/94 Page 21. 


SKINNER 
Today, Springfield Elementary embarks 
on a new era: an era of unbridled 
spending where petro-dollars will fuel 
our wildest educational fantasies. 
These young minds will enjoy every 
academic advantage... (BEAT, CHUCKLING) 
.--until they enter Springfield High 
School, which has no oil well. 

HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT 
(SQUEAKY TEENAGE VOICE) We got an air 
hockey table! 

SKINNER 
Fine. Now, our top student will flip 
the switch to begin pumping our first 
barrel of oil. 
whispers to Skinner. 

SKINNER (CONT’D 
It seems Walter Choy is out sick today, 


so that honor falls to Lisa Simpson. 


Lisa looks excited, runs on stage, and FLIPS the switch. 


LISA 
Thank you. As these fossil fuels fund 
our education, let us educate others 
about renewable energy sources, such as 


geothermal and solar power. 


2F16 FINAL 1 9/9/94 Page 


AUDIENCE 
(VERY MILD, SCATTERED CLAPPING) 
The crowd looks to the top of the derrick in anticipation. 
After a beat, it SPUTTERS pathetically, sending forth a 
small SPLORT of oil. An engineer runs out of the 
building. 
ENGINEER 
There’s no pressure! Someone else has 
tapped this well! 
TITO PUENTE 
Ay! Carumba! 
WHIP PAN across town to: 
EXT. BURNS CONSTRUCTION SITE - THAT MINUTE 
The fence has been removed to reveal what Burns has built: 
a ridiculously slanted derrick that slant-drills into the 
school’s oil deposit. A ROUGHNECK charges past an ecstatic 
Burns and a sour-looking Smithers. 
ROUGHNECK 
Oil ho!! 
BURNS 
Ah. Soon that mighty apparatus will 
burst forth with its precious fluid. 
Almost sexual, isn’t it, Smithers? 
SMITHERS 
(GRUMPY) Eh. 
Burns shoots Smithers a "What’s-wrong-with-you?" glance. 
Just then, the Earth RUMBLES and a powerful gusher rockets 
out of the derrick. 


HIGH ABOVE TOWN 


The slanty derrick arcs a thick stream of oil above several 
city blocks at a thirty-degree angle. 


22. 


2F16 FINAL 1 9/9/94 Page 23. 


INT. BART’S TREEHOUSE - CONTINUOUS 


Bart and SANTA’S LITTLE HELPER take alternating licks from 
an ice cream cone. A drop of oil flies onto the ice cream. 


BART 
Huh? Wahw! 


Bart turns to look outside and is instantly blown across 
the treehouse by the mighty torrent of oil. 


EXT. TREEHOUSE - CONTINUOUS 

The oil stream BLOWS the treehouse apart, exactly like the 
house in the famous "Doomtown" nuclear test film. Bart and 
the dog plummet to the ground. 

EXT. YARD - A FEW MINUTES LATER 


Bart staggers around the yard in a daze while the dog lies 
unconscious under some boards. 


BART 
(INCOHERENT MUTTERING) 
INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS 


Marge doesn’t notice as Maggie points out the window at 
Bart. 


MAGGIE 
(ALARMED PACIFIER SUCKS) 
MARGE 
(SEES OUT WINDOW) Holy Christmas. 
ESTABLISHING SHOT - VETERINARY HOSPITAL - LATER THAT DAY 
INT. VETERINARY HOSPITAL - WAITING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
The family sits anxiously in the waiting room. Bart looks 


okay, aside from a few bandages. The VETERINARIAN emerges 
from a door marked "CANINE TRAUMA WARD." 


2F16 FINAL 1 9/9/94 Page 24. 


VETERINARIAN 
Your dog’s condition has been upgraded 
from "stable" to "frisky," and he’s 
free to go. His legs should be good as 
new in a few months. But in the 
meantime, he’1l have to use the 
Wheelabout. 
We hear wheels SQUEAKING, and Santa’s Little Helper comes 
out, his bandaged hind legs and rear end attached to a 
little cart. He wheels himself over to Bart, who pets him 
sadly. 
SANTA’S LITTLE HELPER 
(CHEERFUL PANTING, BARK) 
BART 
I’ll get even with whoever did this to 
you, boy. I swear it. 
VETERINARIAN 
Oops, almost forgot. Wouldn’t want you 
gnawing on those casts, eh boy? 
The Vet snaps an inverted plastic cone around the dog’s 
head, the kind that looks like a lampshade and keeps dogs 
from chewing on themselves. NELSON walks past, carrying a 
nore with a bandage on its head. They both look at the

INT. SCHOOL - PRINCIPAL’S OFFICE - DAY 


The faculty is gathered around Skinner’s desk. 


2F16 FINAL 1 9/9/94 Page 25. 


SKINNER 
I’m afraid we’ve got no legal recourse 
against Mr. Burns and his slant- 
drilling operation. The oil belongs to 
whoever pumped it first. 

GROUNDSKEEPER WILLIE 
What about all the expensive stuff we 
wanted? Can we still have it? 

SKINNER 
No. 

ALL TEACHERS 
(ROARS OF OUTRAGE AND DISBELIEF) 

SKINNER 
In fact, to pay for the construction, 
and operation, and demolition of our 
new derrick, the school will have to 
eliminate all non-essential programs: 
music... 

MR. LARGO & TITO PUENTE 
What?! / Que?! 

Tito Puente RAMS his fist through his conga drum. 

SKINNER 
And maintenance. 

GROUNDSKEEPER WILLIE 
I’11 kill that Mr. Burns!! (BEAT, LESS 
ENRAGED) And wound that Mr. Smithers. 


Willie STORMS out. 


2F16 FINAL 1 9/9/94 Page 


INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
Homer looks through the mail. Lisa is on the phone, upset. 
LISA 
Oh, no. that’s awful, Mr. Puente. 
(BEAT) What? Oh. He owns the nuclear 
power plant. (BEAT) Yeah, I’d like to 
settle his hash, too. 
Lisa hangs up. Bart enters with the dog SQUEAKING behind 
on its cart. The dog goes out of his way to run over the 
cat’s tail. 
SNOWBALL II 
(HYSTERICAL SCREECH) 
LISA 
Dad, how can you work for a man like 
Mr. Burns? 
HOMER 
Well, he’s not all bad. He did send me 
this nice thank-you card. 
He holds up the card, which has a dumb cartoon of one 
chipmunk handing another chipmunk a four-leaf clover. 
"Thank you," it says in cursive. Lisa opens the card. 
LISA 
"Marge, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie." Dad, 
this doesn’t have your name on it. 


Homer grabs the card, looks at it, and turns very, very 
red. 


HOMER 
(CREEPILY CALM) Kids, would you step 


outside for a second? 


26. 


2F16 FINAL 1 9/9/94 Page 27. 


Bart and Lisa leave. Homer takes a deep breath and opens 
his mouth to yell louder than he’s ever yelled before. 
Just as the sound is about to come out, we SMASH CUT TO a 
church steeple. We hear one second of VERY LOUD, STIRRING 
PIPE ORGAN MUSIC. 
THEN RETURN TO: 
EXT. STREET OUTSIDE SIMPSON HOUSE - CONTINUOUS SCENE 6 
Birds SCATTER off a nearby tree. Up and down the street, 
shocked neighbors stare at the Simpson house. FLANDERS 
leans out his upstairs window in amazement. 
FLANDERS 

Dear Lord. That’s the loudest 

profanity I’ve ever heard. 
Inside the Simpson house, the phone RINGS and is answered. 

HOMER (0.S.) 

Yes, Dad, that was me, 
EXT. MOE’S BAR - DAY 
Burns’ lot now contains several hydraulic pumps in addition 
to the slanty derrick. The pumps emit a deafening 
MECHANICAL DIN and spray Moe’s with spurts of oil and 
clouds of gas. 
INT. MOE’S BAR - CONTINUOUS 


The NOISE is awful, and fumes seep in through the window. 
MOE, BARNEY, and the BARFLIES look ill. 


BARNEY 
This isn’t as fun as beer. Sure, I’m 
all dizzy and nauseous, but where’s the 
inflated sense of self-esteem? 

BARFLY #1 


(HORRIBLE MOAN, COLLAPSES, BODY FALL) 


2F16 FINAL 1 9/9/94 Page 


MOE 
Hey! If you’re getting loaded off them 
fumes, I’m gonna have to charge ya. 


Suddenly, the doors BURST open, and a TEAM OF HEALTH 
INSPECTORS wearing respirators enters. 


MALE INSPECTOR 
(SHOCKED) Man alive! There are men 
alive in here! 


Another inspector holds up a device that is BEEPING 
steadily. 


FEMALE INSPECTOR 
I’m detecting over twenty different 
toxins in the air. 

BARNEY 
(BELCH) 

The device begins BEEPING wildly. 

MALE INSPECTOR 
All right, everybody out! As long as 
Burns is pumping oil, this bar is 
closed. 

MOE 
(STEELY-EYED RAGE) Lemme just get one 
thing. 


Moe reaches beneath the bar, takes out a shotgun, and racks 
it. He marches toward the door. 


BARNEY 
Me too. 


Barney reaches under his barstool and pulls out a 
derringer. He aims it at the health inspectors. 


28. 


2F16 FINAL 1 9/9/94 Page 29. 


BARNEY (CONT’D) 
Up against the wall! 
MOE 
Well, Barn. The guns? They’re for Mr. 
Burns. 
BARNEY 
I said, up against the wall. 
EXT. BURNS OIL SITE - LATE THAT NIGHT 
The PUMPS continue as tanker trucks DRIVE OFF. The CAMERA 
MOVES underground, and we see a large area of the oil 
deposit has been emptied, creating a cavern. The roof of 
the cavern starts to CRUMBLE away. The CAMERA MOVES UP to 
show it’s right below the Retirement Castle. 
INT. RETIREMENT CASTLE - GRAMPA’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Grampa is jolted awake as his room begins TREMBLING. 
GRAMPA 
Earthquake! 


He runs and braces himself under a doorframe. After a 
beat, Grampa and the entire doorframe drop offscreen. 


EXT. RETIREMENT CASTLE - CONTINUOUS 


The west wing of the building has collapsed into a large 
sinkhole. 


GRAMPA, JASPER, OLD JEWISH MAN, ETC 
(SIMULTANEOUS) Nurse! 
INT. POWER PLANT - BURNS’ OFFICE - THE NEXT DAY 
Smithers stands alone on the balcony, surveying 
Springfield: the school, with a large hole where the 
derrick used to be; a boarded-up Moe’s; and the partially- 


collapsed retirement home with tents set up outside. He 
enters Burns’ office. 


2F16 FINAL 1 9/9/94 Page 30. 


SMITHERS 
(SLIGHTLY BITTER) Well, Sir, you’ve 
certainly vanquished all your enemies: 
the elementary school, the local 
tavern, the old age home. You must be 
very proud. 
Burns stands next to a big bail of money, trying to stuff a 
huge wad into his wallet. He finally gives up with a 
disgusted GRUNT, and discards the cash. 
BURNS 
(DRAMATIC) No, not while my greatest 
nemesis still provides our customers 
with free light, heat, and energy. I 
call this enemy... the sun! 
Burns walks across the office to stand amidst a huge scale 
model of Springfield. He pushes a button, and a skylight 


OPENS. A shaft of sunlight shines down on the model, 
simulating day. 


BURNS (CONT’D) 
Since the beginning of time man has 
yearned to destroy the sun. I will do 
the next best thing -- block it out. 
He pushes another button, and the top of Mt. Springfield 
OPENS up. A gigantic, paddle-like object rises from 
within. The paddle moves along in synchronization with the 
sunbean, keeping the city in perpetual shadow. 
SMITHERS 


Good God! 


2F16 FINAL 1 9/9/94 Page 31. 


BURNS 
Imagine it, Smithers. Electrical 
lights and heaters running all day 
long. 

SMITHERS 
But Sir, every plant and tree will die; 
uh, owls will deafen us with incessant 
hooting; and... the town sundial will 
be useless. 


He gestures to the sundial in the model, which sits right 
in front of the model Town Hall. 


SMITHERS (CONT’D) 
(CLEARS THROAT) I don’t want any part 
of this project. It’s 
unconscionably... fiendish. 

BURNS 
(ENRAGED GASP) I will not suffer your 
insubordination! There has been a 
shocking decline in the quality and 
quantity of your toadying, Waylon, and 
you will fall into line. Now. 

SMITHERS 
(THE MOST DIFFICULT THING HE’S EVER 
SAID) No... No, Monty, I won’t. Not 
until you step back from the brink of 
insanity. 

BURNS 


I‘ll do no such thing! You’re fired! 


2F16 FINAL 1 9/9/94 Page 32. 


Smithers STORMS out. Burns turns to the model. 
UPWARDS ANGLE 


Burns looms over the city. Then he starts TROMPING all 
over Springfield, CRUSHING the buildings. 


BURNS 
(DIABOLICAL LAUGHTER) Take that, bowl- 
a-rama! Take that, convenience mart! 
Take that, nuclear power pla-- 
(REALIZES) Oh, fiddlesticks. 


FADE OUT: 


END OF ACT TWO

ACT THREE 
FADE IN: SCENE 7 
CLOSE-UP - NEWSPAPER 
The headline reads: "BURNS PLANS SUNSHINE HALT." Below, a 
graphic says: "Special Section: Your Guide to Perpetual 
Darkness!" 


INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING 


Homer sits concealed behind the paper while Marge gets 
breakfast. Lisa and Bart enter with grim expressions. 


MARGE 
I must say Mr. Burns is being awfully 
inconsiderate. Selfish, even. 

BART 
Burns needs some serious boosta~fazoo. 
Right, Dad? (NO RESPONSE) Dad? Homer? 


Bart RIPS away the newspaper, revealing that it’s not Homer 
but Grampa. 


BART, LISA & GRAMPA 
(SCREAM) 

LISA 
Sorry, Grampa. It’s just that, for a 
second, it looked like Dad had melted. 

GRAMPA 
So what? (BEAT) Well, get used to it, 
cause I’m livin’ here now. I ain’t 
goin’ back to the retirement home 
until they fish my bed outta that 
sinkhole. 


Marge sets down two dishes. 


2F16 FINAL 1 9/9/94 Page 34. 


MARGE 
Strained carrots for Maggie... 
Strained carrots for Grampa. 
GRAMPA 
(JEALOUSLY EYEING MAGGIE) I wanta bib, 
too. 
INT. SIMPSON CAR - EARLY EVENING 


Homer drives along, looking slightly insane. A thought 
bubble with Mr. Burns in it appears next to Homer’s head. 


IMAGINARY BURNS 
Smithers, who is that ignoramus? 
A second bubble appears, also with Burns. Then a few more 
appear in quick succession, filling the front and back 
seats. 
IMAGINARY BURNS #2 
Smithers, who is that lollygagger? 
IMAGINARY BURNS #3 
Who is that blubberpot? 
TEN IMAGINARY BURNSES 
Who is that bafflewit? / ...lummox? / 
Puddinghead? / Mooncalf? / 
Limpnoodle? / Goldbricker? 
Drizzlepuss? / Cueball? / 
Fumblefist? / Galoot? 
HOMER 
(SHAKING HEAD VIOLENTLY) Stop it, stop 
it, stop it! 
TEN IMAGINARY BURNSES 
(ALARMED) Look out! 


2F16 FINAL 1 9/9/94 Page 35. 


HOMER 

What? 
The car CRASHES. Homer gets out to see he’s smashed into 
the wall of the power plant. He calmly OPENS the trunk, 
takes out a bulging duffel bag, and strides into the 
building. Various PROTESTORS picket outside, carrying 
signs that read "SPRINGFIELD NEEDS SUN!," "DOWN WITH 
DIABOLICAL SCHEMES," and "WHO WILL TAN OUR CHILDREN?" 
INT. POWER PLANT - BURNS’ OUTER OFFICE = A LITTLE LATER 


The ornate doors marked "C. Montgomery Burns - PRIVATE" are 
slightly ajar. 


INT. POWER PLANT - BURNS’ OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 


It is pitch black. Homer’s eyes dart around as he does 
something we can’t see. 


HOMER 
(DELIGHTED INSANE GIGGLE) 


Suddenly, the lights switch on. Burns stands in the 
doorway, livid. 


REVERSE ANGLE 
Homer stands in front of the far wall, dwarfed by the huge, 
spray-painted, day-glo words "I AM HOMER SIMPSON." (The 
duffel bag and dozens of empty spray cans lie on the 
floor.) 
BURNS (0.S) 
Who the devil are you?! 
HOMER’S P.O.V. 
We hear weird, psychotic MUSIC as Mr. Burns and the entire 
room rotate to a demented camera angle. Homer charges at 
Burns and begins SHAKING him violently. 
HOMER (SIMULT. W/ BURNS) 
Homer Simpson! Homer Simpson! Shut 


up! Homer Simpson! My name is Homer 


Simpson! 


2F16 FINAL 1 9/9/94 Page 36. 


BURNS (SIMULT. W/ HOMER) 
(BEING SHAKEN) What? What are you 
talking about? Clearly make sense, 
man. I can’t understand a word you’re 
saying. You’re just babbling 
incoherently like some sort of... 


Burns hits the alarm button. Two burly GUARDS rush in and 
drag Homer away. 


GUARDS 
All right, let’s go. C’mon. 

HOMER 
Oh, you’re dead! You're dead! 

BURNS 
Funny. Everyone’s saying I’m a dead 
man lately. (BEAT) Maybe I’d look more 
lively if I mussed my hair a bit. 


He messes up his hair and admires himself in the mirror. 
He looks ridiculous. 


BURNS (CONT’D) 
Almost windblown. Excellent. 
INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - THAT EVENING 


Grampa unpacks his suitcase. Bart walks by, followed by 
Santa’s Little Helper, who still has the cart and cone. 


GRAMPA 
(RE: DOG) Hey, the lamp is runnin’ 
away. 

BART 


(EMBARRASSED) That’s my dog, man. 


2F16 FINAL 1 9/9/94 Page 37. 


GRAMPA 
So long, lamp. (TO BART) Now stop 
loafing, and help your grampa unpack. 


Bart looks in the suitcase and pulls out a cigar box. He 
opens it to reveal a gleaming revolver. 


BART 
Wow! 
GRAMPA 
That’s my old Smith & Wesson. If 
you’re gonna play with it, be careful, 
cause it’s loaded. 
Bart takes out the gun. Just then, Marge enters. 
MARGE 
(SCREAM) Bart! Put that down! 
Guns are very dangerous, and I won’t 
have them in this house. 
GRAMPA 
How can ya have a house without a gun? 
What if a bear came through the door? 
Marge picks up the gun and puts it back in the box. 
MARGE 
(SOTTO) I’m going to bury it in the 
backyard where little hands can’t get 
to it. (EXITS) 
GRAMPA 
(FRUSTRATED, TO BART) Echt! Ya shoulda 
fired into the air! She woulda run 


off! 


2F16 FINAL 1 9/9/94 Page 38. 


SCENE 8 
ESTABLISHING SHOT - TOWN HALL - THE NEXT AFTERNOON 
INT. TOWN HALL = CONTINUOUS 
A town meeting is beginning. 
MAYOR QUIMBY 

People! People! I will not allow Mr. 

Burns to block out our sun. It’s time 

for decisive action! I have here a 

polite but firm letter to Mr. Burns’ 

underlings who, with some cajoling, 

will pass it along to him, or at least 

give him the gist of it. 
While Quimby is speaking, we CLOSE-UP on a pair of hands 
lovingly fondling a gun. We see a second pair of hands 
doing the same. Then, a third. An AIDE WHISPERS to 
Quimby. 

MAYOR QUIMBY (CONT’D) 

Also, it has been brought to my 

attention that a number of you are 

stroking guns. (BEAT) Therefore, I 

will step aside and open up the floor. 


Smithers stands up. He is unshaven and disheveled and 
possibly drunk. 


SMITHERS 
Mr. Burns was the closest thing I ever 
had to a friend. (BITTER) But he fired 
me, and now I spend my days drinking 
cheap scotch and watching Comedy 


Central. 


2F16 FINAL 1 9/9/94 Page 


DR. HIBBERT 
(APPALLED) Oh! Dear God! 
Ned Flanders runs up and puts a blanket around Smithers. 
SMITHERS 
Aw. It’s not that bad. I mean, I 
never miss "Pardon My Zinger." 
WILLIE 
Burns cost me my groundskeepin’ job at 
the school! And I’m too superstitious 
to take the one at the cemetery. 
GRAMPA 
A-causa him, I lost my room, my things, 
and my friend’s collection of old 
sunbathing magazines! 
OLD JEWISH MAN 
(SHOCKED) You bastid! 
Furious PEOPLE start standing up in very quick succession. 
MOE 
I lost my bar! 
BARNEY 
I lost his bar! 
LISA 
He robbed the school of music! 
PRINCIPAL SKINNER 
He robbed the school of financial 


security! 


2F16 FINAL 1 9/9/94 Page 40. 


TITO PUENTE 
He robbed the school of Tito! 
HOMER 
He can’t remember my name! 
MARGE 
He’s causing us all to yell! 
MAGGIE 
(TWO IRATE SUCKS) 
BART 
Look what he did to my best friend! 
Everyone turns to look at Milhouse, who is eating a bag of 
cheez doodles and has orange powder all over his face. He 
looks up to see the crowd staring at him. 
MILHOUSE 
(MOUTH FULL) Whug? 
BART 
No, my dog! 
There is a hushed, mortified silence as Santa’s Little 
Helper (still in cone) wheels himself SQUEAKILY down the 
aisle. The silence is broken by... 
BURNS (0.S.) 
(EVIL SNICKER) 
The crowd turns to see Burns standing in the entranceway. 
BURNS 
Those wheels are squeaking a bit. 
Perhaps I could sell him a little oil. 
SANTA’S LITTLE HELPER 


(SNARLS THREATENINGLY AT MR. BURNS) 


2F16 FINAL 1 9/9/94 Page 41. 


BART 
You twisted old monster! ! 
Bart rushes at Mr. Burns. 
BURNS 
Nuh-uh-uh. 


Burns opens his jacket to reveal a pistol in a shoulder 
holster. Bart stops abruptly. 


BURNS (CONT’D) 
I’ve decided to protect myself... Ever 
since I was attacked in my office by an 
unidentified assailant. 

HOMER (0.S.) 
(QUIET ANNOYED GRUNT) 

OLD SEA CAPTAIN 
Arr! Burns, yer scurvy schemes will 
earn ye a one-way passage to the 
boneyard! 

FLANDERS 
Uh, I’d like to hear from Sideshow Mel. 

SIDESHOW MEL 
I‘ll see to it that Mr. Burns suffers 
the infernal machinations of Hell’s 
grim tyrant! 

oTTto 
Yeah! 

BURNS 
Oh, you all talk big, but who here is 
going to stop me? 


2F16 FINAL 1 9/9/94 Page 42. 


The crowd stares icily at Burns, MUTTERING darkly. Burns 
turns to exit. 


BURNS 
(KNOWING) Mmm hmm. Very well. One 
last question: (TAUNTING) Have you 
ever seen the sun set at 3:00 PM? 
OLD SEA CAPTAIN 
Aye! Once when I was sailing ‘round 
the Arctic Cir... 
BURNS 
Shut up, you! Take one last look at 
the sun, Springfield. 
Burns pulls out a remote control and hits the button. 
Through the door we see the paddle rise up, blocking out 
the sun. Each window of the town hall sequentially goes 
dark as it falls into shadow. The CROWD MUMBLES and 
MURMURS ominously. Burns LAUGHS evilly and swaggers down 
the walkway. A second later, a sports car screeches up. 
KRUSTY gets out and bounds up the steps, carrying a 
suitcase. 
KRUSTY 
Hey, hey! (CHUCKLES) I’ve been in 
Reno for six weeks. Did I miss 
anything? (OFF THEIR MURDEROUS LOOKS:) 
What the.. (KRUSTY GROAN) 
EXT. TOWN HALL STEPS - A FEW MINUTES LATER SCENE 9 


The fuming CITIZENS stream out of the hall and look up at 
the darkened sky in awe. 


LUNCHLADY DORIS 
Eternal darkness. Well, that’s just 


great. 


2F16 FINAL 1 9/9/94 Page 


APU 
Listen, someone’s got to get that Mr. 
Burns. Uh, where’s a gun-toting low- 
life when you need one? 
JAILBIRD 
What can I do ya for, amigo? 
ANOTHER ANGLE 


Burns walks alongside the town hall, gloating as the 
streetlights go on. 


BURNS 
Ha! A splendid afternoon bathed in the 
eerie glow of wasted energy! Dear old 
Jimmy Carter would be appalled. 

JIMMY CARTER 
Darn tootin’. I/’d kick your ass if my 
joints weren’t so stiff. 


Ominous MUSIC builds as we begin a series of dramatic 
CUTAWAYS. 


CUTAWAY TO: INT. TOWN HALL 
Carl picks an abandoned jacket off a bench. 
CARL 
That’s odd. Mr. Smithers left his 
jacket behind. 
CUTAWAY TO: OUTSIDE 


Burns strolls along, WHISTLING happily. 


43. 


2F16 FINAL 1 9/9/94 Page 44. 


CUTAWAY TO: INT. TOWN HALL 
oTto 
Whoa. That’s odd. Principal Skinner 
left his mother behind. 


We see Skinner’s Mom sitting primly in the middle of the 
empty town hall. 


CUTAWAY TO: BACK OUTSIDE 
Burns continues on. 
CUTAWAY TO: TOWN HALL PARKING LOT 
Marge loads Santa’s Little Helper and Maggie into the car. 
Then, she notices the rest of the family hasn’t followed 
her. 
MARGE 

That’s odd. Where’s Homer? And Bart? 

And Lisa? And Grampa? 
CUTAWAY TO: OUTSIDE 
The MUSIC builds as Burns continues his walk. 
CUTAWAY TO: SIMPSON BACKYARD 


Grampa’s cigar box has been dug up and lies empty beside 
the hole. 


CUTAWAY TO: 
BURNS 
After all these years, things are 
finally starting to go my way. I feel 
like celebrating. I... 
Burns rounds a corner. We cannot see where he’s gone or 


who he’s talking to. While Burns speaks, ominous MUSIC 
builds to a crescendo. 


2F16 FINAL 1 9/9/94 Page 45. 


BURNS (0.S.) 
Oh, it’s you. What are you so happy 
about? (GASP) I see. Well, I think 
you’d better drop it. (THREATENING) I 
said drop it! (VIOLENT STRUGGLING 
SOUNDS) 
INT. FRONT OF TOWN HALL 
Marge is looking for the family. 
MARGE 
Where is everybody? 
Suddenly, a GUNSHOT RINGS out from behind the building. 
MARGE (CONT’D) 
(GASP) 


Mr. Burns staggers around the side of the town hall, 
holding his hand to a wound in his chest. 


JIMBO 
Hey, man, are you okay? 

BURNS 
(WHEEZING) Won’t... dignify that... 
with response. 


Burns lurches southward towards the town sundial, finally 
collapsing onto it. 


OVERHEAD SHOT 
Burns falls across the face of the sundial. His arms fall 
in the 9:30 position, reaching towards the compass points 
"Ss" and "W." A crowd gathers around. 

PATTY 


Mr. Burns has been shot! 


2F16 FINAL 1 9/9/94 Page 46. 


WIGGUM 
(NOTICES SOMETHING) Just a minute! 
This isn’t Mr. Burns at all! It’sa 
mask! 
He tries to pull the mask off. 
WIGGUM (CONT’D) 
Oh, wait. It is Burns. (NERVOUS 
CHUCKLE) His wrinkly skin looks... 
looks like a mask. 
MARGE 
I don’t think we’ll ever know who did 
this. Everyone in town’s a suspect. 
DR. HIBBERT 
(CHUCKLES) Well, I couldn’t possibly 
solve this mystery. (TO CAMERA) Can 
you? 


WIDEN to reveal that Dr. Hibbert is directly addressing 
Chief Wiggum, who’s in the foreground. 


WIGGUM 
Yeah, I’11 give it a shot. I mean, 
it’s my job, right? 


FADE OUT:

ACT ONE 
FADE IN: 
EXT. SIMPSON FRONT YARD - SATURDAY AFTERNOON 


HOMER sweats and GRUMBLES as he mows the lawn with a push 
mower. MARGE waters the patio plants. 


HOMER 
(UNDER HIS BREATH) Bust my hump all 
week... stupid grass... This is 
supposed to be the boy's job. 
MARGE 
Now, now, Homer. Bart's busy working 
on his science project. 
BART pokes his head out of his bedroom window. 
BART 
You heard the lady, Homer. 
BART'S BEDROOM POV 


Bart has stuck toothpicks in a sweet potato and suspended 
it in a glass of water. 


BART (CONT'D) 
So please mow quietly. Genius at work. 
HOMER 
(GRUMBLING TO HIMSELF) I'll mow you, 


you little... 


TABLE DRAFT 5/23/90 PAGE 2. 


Bart sits down at his desk, picks up a Radioactive Man 
comic book, puts his feet up on the desk and sips a soft 
drink. After a few minutes, he puts down the comicbook, 
and picks up a logy he's been keeping of his science 
project. 
BART (CONT'D) 

(WRITING) "One o'clock -- still just a 

potato. 
CLOSE-UP - BART'S LOG 


Bart makes two ditto marks under a column where every half 
hour is recorded "still just a potato." 


EXT. SIMPSON HOUSE = FRONT YARD - CONTINUOUS 
HOMER 
What's the point of having kids if you 
can't make 'em do the lousy chores? 
Marge MUTTERS something and goes into the house. As Homer 
continues mowing, his next-door neighbor, NED FLANDERS, 
appears and begins filling his birdhouse trough with seed. 
A collection of beautifully feathered birds immediately 
begin to feed. 
FLANDERS 
(PLEASANTLY) Hey there, neighbor! The 
Lord's certainly given us a beautiful 
day today. 
HOMER 
(NOT REAL FRIENDLY) H'lo, Flanders. 
FLANDERS 
Doing a little yardwork, eh? 
HOMER 
(SARCASTIC) Who told? (CALLING TO 
MARGE) Marge! Could you bring me a 


beer? Make it a tall boy! 


TABLE DRAFT 5/23/90 PAGE 3. 


FLANDERS 
Say Simpson, I've got a spray that'll 
get rid of that crabgrass ina jif 
HOMER 
Crabgrass? What are you talking about? 
Where? 
FLANDERS 
Well, (POINTING) there... there... 
there... there's a big patch over 
there. Practically your entire front 
yard. 
HOMER 
(DEFENSIVE) Hey, there's nothing wrong 
with crabgrass! It just has a bad 
name. Everyone would love it if it had 
a cute name like... uh... elfgrass. 
FLANDERS 
(CHUCKLES) You may be right! 
HOMER 
(HOLLERING) Marge! Where's the Duff? 
MARGE (V.0O.) 
We're all out, Homer. 
Homer GRUNTS. 
HOMER 
Did you check the vegetable bin? 


Sometimes one falls in there. 


TABLE DRAFT 5/23/90 PAGE 4. 


MARGE 
I checked, Homer. 
HOMER 
(ANNOYED GRUNT) 
MARGE 
Would you like some fruit juice? 
HOMER 
(THROUGH HIS TEETH) Don't mess with 
me, woman. 
FLANDERS 
Couldn't help overhearing, Simpson. 
I've got some ice cold brew in the 
rumpus room, if you'd like to join me. 
HOMER 
Well, uh, I guess that would be okay. 
FLANDERS 
Tee-rific! Suds ahoy! 
HOMER 


What the heck, I earned a little break. 


A WIDE SHOT reveals that Homer has mowed half of one strip. 


They exit. 


FLANDERS HOUSE - BASEMENT/RUMPUS ROOM - CONTINUOUS 


Homer and Ned enter. Homer GASPS. WIDEN OUT to show that 
the rumpus room contains a bumper pool table, dart board, 
electric train layout, a soccer set, a foosball table, 
trophy case, a fully-stocked bar, thick carpeting and a 
coat of arms. 


TABLE DRAFT 5/23/90 PAGE 


HOMER 
Holy moly! Bumper pool, foosball, 
carpeting! This looks like the rumpus 
at the Taj Mahal. 

FLANDERS 
Say, that's right. This is your first 
visit to the Flanders homestead. 

HOMER 
Well, we've only been neighbors, uh, 
(COUNTING ALL OF HIS FINGERS) eight 
years. 


Ned's attractive wife, MAUDE, enters with a platter of 
sandwiches. 


FLANDERS 
There's my little Popcorn Ball. 
MAUDE 
Hello, Sponge Cake. 
They hug. 
FLANDERS 
Forgive me, Simpson. I haven't seen my 
wife in several minutes. 
MAUDE 
I thought you boys might be hungry, so 
I fixed you some club sandwiches. 
CLOSE-UP - PLATTER 


An elaborate platter of club sandwiches with fancy 
toothpicks holding them together. 


TABLE DRAFT 5/23/90 PAGE 6. 


HOMER 
Geez. Toothpicks. 
FLANDERS 
Isn't she wonderful, Simpson? 
HOMER 
Yeah, but aren't we forgetting 
something, Flanders? 
FLANDERS 
Oh, your beer. Is draft okay? Just put 
in the tap last week. 
Homer takes a big bite out of a club sandwich as Flanders 
takes a big stein labelled "Macho Mug" from his collection 
of steins and draws Homer a draft. 
FLANDERS (CONT'D) 
This is a tasty little lager called 
"Van Alstein". 
HOMER 
Never heard of it. 
FLANDERS 
It's imported all the way from Holland. 
HOMER 
Well, beggars can't be choosers. 
Homer chugs down the glass of beer and then BURPS. The 
Flander's wholesome young son TODD enters. Todd is carrying 
a model of the double helix. 
TODD 
Hey, Dad, thanks for helping me with my 


science project. 


TABLE DRAFT 5/23/90 PAGE 7. 


FLANDERS 
My pleasure, Study Buddy. 
TODD 
To show my appreciation, I'm gonna give 
the lawn a quick mow. 
FLANDERS 
Why, you don't have to do that, son. 
TODD 
I know, but I want to. You're the best 
Dad in the whole world. 
Homer watches all this with wide-eyed amazement. 
FLANDERS 
(CHIDING) Now, you know how that 
embarrasses me. 
Todd exits. 
FLANDERS (CONT'D) 
(TO HOMER) Kids can be a trial 
sometimes. 
HOMER 
(ANGRY) All right, knock it off! 
FLANDERS 


Uh, knock what off, Simpson? 


TABLE DRAFT 5/23/90 PAGE 


HOMER 
You've been rubbing my nose in it since 
I got here. Your family is better than 
my family. Your beer comes from 
farther away than my beer. You and 
your son like each other. Your wife's 
butt is higher than my wife's butt. 
You make me sick! 

Flanders emits a little GASP. 

FLANDERS 
(FORMALLY) Simpson, I'm afraid I'm 
going to have to ask you to leave. I 
hope you understand. 

HOMER 
I wouldn't stay on a bet! 


Homer quickly finishes his beer, grabs the another sandwich 
off the plate and storms out, SLAMMING the door behind hin. 


INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Marge and Homer are in bed. 
MARGE 
Homer, quit tossing. 
HOMER 
Sorry, Marge. It's just that I'm still 
steamed up about that jerk Flanders. 
(GRUMBLING) Lousy... bragging... know- 
it-all... show-off... 
MARGE 


What exactly did he say, Homer? 


TABLE DRAFT 5/23/90 PAGE 


HOMER 
Get this. He said... well... okay, 
look, I don't have a legal transcript, 
but it wasn't so much what he said, it 
was how he said it! 

MARGE 
Well, how did he say it? Was he angry? 
Was he rude? 

HOMER 
Okay, okay. It wasn't how he said it 
either, but the message was loud and 
clear... We stink! 

MARGE 
Homer, as your best friend, I've seen 
you bad-mouth Ned Flanders for years 
and, frankly, I've never seen him be 
anything but a perfect neighbor. 

HOMER 
Oh, he's perfect now, is he? 

MARGE 
Well, he's not perfect, but he is very 
nice. 

HOMER 
No, no, Marge. Don't backpedal. You 
were right the first time. He's 
perfect. Perfect in every way. 


He pulls back the covers. 


TABLE DRAFT 5/23/90 PAGE 


HOMER (CONT'D) 
I'm just gonna go take a walk around 
the block to calm down. I got a little 
excited. (POINTED) I'm not perfect. 

Homer exits. 

EXT. SIMPSON HOUSE - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS 


Homer is his bathrobe and slippers starts around the block. 
As he passes the Flanders house, we PULL IN. 


INT. FLANDERS HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS 


Ned and Maude are asleep in their large canopy bed which is 
surrounded by many pictures of their happy family. 


MAUDE 
Ned, you're tossing. What's the 
matter? 

FLANDERS 
I feel terrible. I forget that we do 
have things better than the Simpsons. 
I have him over. He has a few beers. 
You can't blame him for erupting. And 
what do I do? I turn into a snarling 
beast. Talk about flunking turn-the- 
other-cheek! 

MAUDE 
Well, Ned, I do have some thoughts on 
this but maybe I'm not the one you 
should be talking to. 

NED 


You're right. 


10. 


TABLE DRAFT 5/23/90 PAGE 11. 


CLOSE-UP = FLANDERS' TELEPHONE 
On the face of the phone we see the speed dial numbers: 
"Reverend-Work," "Reverend-Home", “Recycling Center" and 
"Book Mobile". Flanders pushes the "Reverend-Home" button. 
FLANDERS. 
(INTO PHONE) Hello, Reverend Lovejoy. 
INT. REVEREND LOVEJOY'S BEDROOM 
Reverend and Mrs. Lovejoy are asleep in bed. 
MRS. LOVEJOY 
(INTO PHONE) No, this is Mrs. Lovejoy. 
Just a minute. (TO REVEREND) Honey, 
honey, wake up. It sounds like Ned 
Flanders is having some sort of crisis. 
REVEREND LOVEJOY 
Probably stepped on a worm. (INTO 
PHONE) Hello, Ned. 
FLANDERS 
(INTO PHONE) Reverend, I'm sorry to 
bother you at this hour but I'm 
troubled. I threw a man out of my 
house today. 
REVEREND 
(INTO PHONE, YAWNING) Well, nobody's 
perfect. 
FLANDERS 
(INTO PHONE) I feel like I've violated 


Matthew 19:19. 


TABLE DRAFT 5/23/90 PAGE 12. 


LOVEJOY 
(INTO PHONE) Huh? 
FLANDERS 
(INTO PHONE) "Love thy neighbor." 
LOVEJOY 
(INTO PHONE) Oh. Right, right. 
FLANDERS 
(INTO PHONE) Could I come over so we 
can discuss it more fully? 
LOVEJOY 
(INTO PHONE) Ned, you'll be seeing me 
at church in six hours. However, since 
you seem so troubled, it might help to 
share your feelings with the man you 
offended. 
FLANDERS 
(INTO PHONE) Good idea. I'11 call him 
right now. 
LOVEJOY 
(INTO PHONE) Unless you're a big 
contributor to his rectory fund, may I 
suggest you write him a letter? 
FLANDERS 
(INTO PHONE) That is a jim-dandy idea! 
Bless you, Reverend. 
LOVEJOY 


(INTO PHONE) Yeah, yeah, yeah... 


TABLE DRAFT 5/23/90 PAGE 13. 


We hear a CLICK on the other end of the line. Flanders 
hops out of bed. 


CLOSE-UP - DESK 


Ned is writing on his notepaper which is inscribed, "From 
The Noggin of Ned." 


FLANDERS 
(WRITING) "Dear Neighbor... " 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. SIMPSON HOUSE - NIGHT 
Flanders, in bathrobe and slippers, approaches the front 
door holding a letter. As he stoops to slip it in the mail 
slot, Homer, also in his robe and slippers, steps up behind 
him. 
HOMER 
Flanders! 
Flanders SCREAMS. 
HOMER (CONT'D) 
What are you doing? 
FLANDERS 
I don't blame you for being upset with 
me, Homer. I just wanted to give you 
this letter. I'll leave now. 
HOMER 
Yeah, you do that. 
Flanders hurries away. 
HOMER (CONT'D) 
(MUTTERING) Spy... peeping Tom... 
trespassing burglar. 


Homer looks curiously at the letter and opens it. 


TABLE DRAFT 5/23/90 PAGE 14. 


HOMER (CONT'D) 
(READING) "Dear neighbor... 
Homer starts to CHUCKLE. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - KITCHEN - THE NEXT AFTERNOON 


The whole family is seated at lunch. Homer is reading 
Flanders' letter aloud. Everyone but Marge is GIGGLING. 


HOMER 
(READING, LAUGHING) "... You are my 
brother. I love you. We are not on 
this earth to live up to each other's 
expectations, and yet I feel a great 
sadness in my boson." 
Everyone but Marge really CRACKS UP at the word "bosom." 
MARGE 
I think it's terrible. A man opens his 
heart and you make fun of him. 
Marge leaves the roon. 
INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 


The instant the door closes behind her, Marge covers her 
mouth with her hand and emits a PEEP of laughter. 


INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS 
Marge, with a straight face, reenters the breakfast room as 


Homer finishes reading the letter. Everyone is still 
LAUGHING. 


TABLE DRAFT 5/23/90 PAGE 15. 


HOMER 
(READING, LAUGHING) "... Let us not be 
neighbors because of a shared property 
line. Let us be neighbors because of 
common respect and affection for each 
other. Neighbors forever, Ned 
Flanders." 

BART 
What a sap! 

LISA 
Read the bosom part again, Dad. 

They all LAUGH at the word "bosom" again. 

MARGE 
Now, just a minute. There are some 
things about the Flanders family that I 
wish we had around this house. 

HOMER 
What besides beer? 

MARGE 
They're a very close-knit family. 

HOMER 
You know, she's absolutely right! 
Today we're gonna do something and blow 
them right out of the water 
togetherness-wise! What does everyone 


say to a round of miniature golf? 


TABLE DRAFT 5/23/90 PAGE 16. 


MARGE 
Well, I was going to wash my hair. 
LISA 
And I'm studying for the Math Fair. 
If I win one of the awards, I'll bring 
home a brand new protractor. 
HOMER 
Too bad we don't live on a farm. (TO 
BART) That just leaves you, me, and 
the baby. Let's go, boy. 
Homer picks up Maggie as he and Bart exit. 
EXT. FAMILY FUN CENTER - AFTERNOON 
Homer, Bart and Maggie drive up to a sprawling family 
entertainment complex. The sign reads "Sir Putt-A-Lot's 
Merrie Olde Fun Centre... Ye Go Karts... Her Majesty's 
Batting Cage... Merlin's Video Game Dungeon... Fkee Ball," 
with a logo of Henry the Eighth holding a golf club. The 
miniature golf course features lots of crazy statuary. 
BART 
Here we are! Ever play before, Homer? 
HOMER 
Are you kidding? I've played miniature 
golf for years! I got a hole in one 
once. 
EXT. MINIATURE GOLF COURSE - FIRST HOLE - CONTINUOUS 
HOMER 
Okay, boy, here we go. Fore! 
Homer hits the ball. It goes through the alligator's legs 


into the middle hole. Bart rushes to look at the two holes 
near the green. The ball doesn't come out. 


TABLE DRAFT 5/23/90 PAGE 17. 


CLOSE-UP - HOLE 


The ball PLOPS out onto a little green. We PULL OUT to 
reveal we are in the parking lot. 


HOMER 
(WHINY PROTEST) But I got it in the 
middle! 
A car drives by and knocks Homer's ball down the highway. 
HOMER (CONT'D) 
(ANNOYED GRUNT) 
EXT. MINIATURE GOLF COURSE - SKULL HOLE - CONTINUOUS 


We see a hole where the obstacle is a giant skull. Maggie 
appears inside the skull and crawls out of one of the eyes. 


EXT. MINIATURE GOLF COURSE - WINDMILL HOLE - CONTINUOUS 
She crawls past the windmill, which hooks the hood of her 
coat and takes her around a full spin. She continues 
crawling without breaking stride. She crawls past Ned and 
Todd Flanders, who are also playing a little miniature 
golf. 
FLANDERS 
Hey, there's Homer Simpson! What a 
perfect opportunity to follow up on my 
letter. 
EXT. MINIATURE GOLF COURSE - CONTINUOUS 
At "Hole 15", Homer is preparing to hit his ball into the 
mouth of a huge gorilla wearing a mortar board. Bart is 
cockily leaning on his club. 
BART 
Give up, Homer. There's a six-stroke 


limit. 


TABLE DRAFT 5/23/90 PAGE 


HOMER 
I know, I know. I can still make this 
for a five. (CONCENTRATES) Come on, 
baby, pleeze go in. Please let me beat 
the boy. 
Homer's shot bonks oft the gorilla's face and rolls back 
down the ramp, hitting Homer's putter with a delicate PING. 
Bart LAUGHS. Homer throws down his club. 
HOMER (CONT'D) 
(SPUTTERING) Stupid over-educated 
baboon... 
At this moment, the Flanders approach. 
FLANDERS. 
Hi, Simpson! Having fun? 
HOMER 
Flanders! What are you doing here? 
FLANDERS 
Just playing a little mini-golf with 
the Todd-meister. 
TODD 
(FRIENDLY) Hi, Bart! 
BART 
(SCOWLING) Hi, Todd. 
FLANDERS 
Say, now that we're all friends again, 
why don't we make a foursome? 


Homer and Bart halfheartedly respond, "Well, okay," "That 
sounds great," "Sure, Flanders." 


18. 


TABLE DRAFT 5/23/90 PAGE 19. 


FLANDERS 
All right! This will be fun! 
Say, looked like you were having a 
little trouble there? 
HOMER 
That shot is impossible! Jack 
Nicholson himself couldn't make it. 
TODD 
It is difficult, Mr. Simpson. The best 
strategy is to play conservatively. 
Hug the rail. It won't go in, but you 
set yourself up for an easy deuce. 


Todd putts the ball along the rail. It goes right in the 
cup. 


TODD (CONT'D) 
Oh, well, it went in. 
FLANDERS, 
Good shot, Todd! (TO HOMER) Doesn't 
it give you a kick when your kid beats 
you at something? 
HOMER 
Yeah, it's the greatest. (ASIDE TO 
BART) Luck. 
EXT. MINIATURE GOLF COURSE - LATER 


Bart totals up the final score as he, Todd and Homer trudge 
away from the 18th hole. 


TABLE DRAFT 5/23/90 PAGE 


BART 
Final score: Bart, forty-one. Homer... 
let's see, six plus six plus six plus 
six plus six... 
HOMER 
Never mind! 
TODD 
Hey, look! 
They turn and see a sign whichs reads: 
Sir Putt-A-Lot's 1st Annual 
MINIATURE GOLF TOURNAMENT 
1ST PRIZE: $50 
2ND PRIZE: $10 
3RD PRIZE: $5 
4TH PRIZE: 1/2 PRICE SNO-CONE 
TODD 
Wow! First prize, fifty dollars! 
BART 
Wow! Third prize, five dollars! 
HOMER 
Where'd you come up with an attitude 
like that, boy? If the competition's 
weak and you get a few lucky putts, you 
could win this thing. 


Flanders walks up with two sodas. 


TABLE DRAFT 5/23/90 PAGE 


FLANDERS, 
So, Bart, thinking of entering the 
tournament? 

HOMER 
Yesh, he entering and what's more, he's 
going to win, aren't you, boy? 

BART 
(HALFHEARTEDLY) Yeah, I guess it's 
possible. 

FLANDERS 
Hey, I like that confidence. 

HOMER 
That's right! I have confidence, I 
have love. I think the fruit of my 
loins can beat the fruit of your loins 
any day of the week. 

FLANDERS 
But Simpson, you know you may be 
putting a little too much pressure on 
the boy. My Todd's awfully good. 

HOMER 
It's a simple act of faith between 
father and son, just as classy as any 
feelings you can have. 

FLANDERS 
Well, just so long as they have fun. 


As the Flanders move off, Todd tosses his scorecard into a 
Henry VIII big-mouth trashcan. 


TABLE DRAFT 5/23/90 PAGE 22. 


HOMER 
(MIMICKING) "Just so long as they have 
fun." I'd expect something like that 
out of you. Come on, boy. 
Bart dives into the trashcan, emerges with the Flanders 
scorecard. Todd's column shows eleven twos and seven ones, 
for a total of 29. 
BART 
(GULPS) Homer, there's no way. 
HOMER 
Bart, this is the only time I'm ever 
gonna say this to you. It is not okay 
to lose. 
FADE OUT. 


ND_O CT ONE

ACT TWO 


FADE IN: 
EXT. SIMPSON HOUSE - BACKYARD = THE NEXT MORNING 
From about a yard away, Bart attempts to putt a golf ball 
through Santa's Little Helper's legs into a small hole 
they've dug in the back yard. Homer is coaching. 
HOMER 
(TO SANTA'S LITTLE HELPER) Okay, boy, 
stay, stay. Good dog. Now, keep your 
head down. 
Santa's Little Helper lowers his head. 
HOMER (CONT'D) 
No, not you. I'm talking to the boy. 
(TO BART) Keep your head down. Follow 
through... 
Bart misses the shot. 
HOMER (CONT'D) 
Okay, that didn't work. This time move 
your head. Don't follow through. 
BART 
Homer, it's hopeless. 
HOMER 
That's no attitude. What if Columbus 
had said, "it's hopeless"? We'd be 
playing miniature golf on some crummy 


course in Europe. 


TABLE DRAFT 5/23/90 PAGE 24. 


Flanders pokes his head over the hedge. 
FLANDERS 
Practice-practice-practice, eh? 
HOMER 
Yeah. And my kid is gonna beat the 
crap-crap-crap out of your kid. 
FLANDERS 
(CHUCKLING) Funny-funny-funny. 
HOMER 
Show him how a winner does it, Bart. 
Bart is visibly nervous. He hits the short putt so hard it 
flies across the yard, shattering one of the Simpsons' lawn 
gnome. 
FLANDERS 
(KINDLY) Nice firm stroke. 
HOMER 
(QUICKLY) Uh, good shot, Bart! You 
hit the gnome just like I told you to, 
in a voice too small for anyone else to 
hear. Let's practice inside for a 
while. 
Bart is still gripping the club as Homer leads him away. 
PAN UP to Lisa and Marge watching from a window. They 
shake their heads and make DISAPPROVING MURMURS. 
INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - BART'S BEDROOM - A MINUTE LATER 


Homer and Bart enter. Bart is carrying the putter. He 
tosses it on the floor. 


TABLE DRAFT 5/23/90 PAGE 25. 


HOMER 
(OUTRAGED) What're you doing? That 
putter is to you what a bat is toa 
baseball player, what a hockey stick is 
to a hockey player, what a violin is to 
a... violin guy. Now, c'mon, give your 
putter a name. 

BART 
What? 

HOMER 
Come on, give it a name. 

BART 
(TIMIDLY) Mr. Putter. 

HOMER 
Do you wanna try a little harder, son? 
Come on, give it a good name. 

BART 
Homer? 

HOMER 
No, no, a girl's name. 

BART 
Mom? 

HOMER 
(GRUFFLY) Your putter's name is 
Charlene! 

BART 


Why? 


TABLE DRAFT 5/23/90 PAGE 26. 


HOMER 
It just is. 


Homer sticks a smiling photo of Todd Flanders in Bart's 
bureau mirror. 


HOMER (CONT'D) 
Now, this is a picture of your enemy, 
Todd Flanders. Every day I want you to 
spend fifteen minutes staring at it and 
concentrating on how much you hate him 
and how glorious it will be when you 
and Charlene kick his butt. 
BART 
Who's Charlene? 
Homer picks up the putter and brandishes it. 
HOMER 
(ANGRY) I'1l show you who Charlene is! 
Now start hating! 
Homer exits. Bart stares at the picture for several beats, 
then sighs and looks out the window. He sees Todd looking 
at him from inside his own bedroom, smiling and waving. 
TODD 
(FRIENDLY) Hi, Bart. 
INT. SIMPSON KITCHEN - DAY 
Marge is in the kitchen. Homer enters. 
MARGE 
Homer, I couldn't help overhearing you 
warp Bart's mind. 


HOMER 


TABLE DRAFT 5/23/90 PAGE 27. 


MARGE 
Well, I'm worried that you're making 
too big a deal of this silly little 
kiddie golf tournament. 
HOMER 
But, Marge, this is our big chance to 
show up the Flanderses. 
MARGE 
Well, I'm sure it is, but why do we 
want to do that? 
HOMER 
Because sometimes the only way you can 
feel good about yourself is by making 
someone else look bad. (BITTERLY) And 
I'm tired of making other people feel 
good about themselves. 
INT. BART'S BEDROOM - DAY 
Bart is looking at his modest collection of tiny trophies 
and brown, yellow and gray ribbons reading "Bart Simpson, 
4th Place", "Honorable Mention", "Participant", "6TH", 
"Everybody Gets A Trophy Day". Lisa enters. 
LISA 
Hi, Bart. What're you doing? 
BART 
Reliving past triumphs. What do you 
call those guys in chess that don't 


matter? 


TABLE DRAFT 5/23/90 PAGE 28. 


LISA 
Well, a blockaded bishop can be of 
little or no value, but I think you're 
referring to a pawn. 
BART 
Well, you're looking at one of those. 
LISA 
I know. It's times like this that I'm 
thankful Dad has little to no interest 
in almost everything I do. Bart, I 
think I can help you. 
BART 
What do you know about miniature golf? 
LISA 
I know that, like any other game, it's 
ten percent skill and ninety percent 
will. Come with me, Bart. 
BART 
(CONSIDERS) Well... Okay. What have I 


got to lose. 


Bart picks up the putter. 


LISA 
Leave the putter. You won't be needing 


it. 


Puzzled, Bart exits with Lisa. 
EXT. SPRINGFIELD PUBLIC LIBRARY - DAY 


Bart and Lisa arrive on their bikes.

BART 
Hey, man, this is the library! What 
are we doing here? 

LISA 
There are books here that can make you 
a champion. 

BART 
But I didn't bring any money. 

LISA 
It's free, Bart. 


LIBRARY - CONTINUOUS 


Bart and Lisa pass the LIBRARIAN. 


LIBRARIAN 
Hi, Lisa. 
LISA 


Hi, Mrs. Norton. 


They pass a MAN pushing a cart full of books. 


MAN 
Hi, Lisa. 

LISA 
Hey, Ralph. 


They approach the card catalog. There's a table full of 
SENIOR CITIZENS. 


SENIOR CITIZENS 
(IN UNISON) Hi, Lisa. 

LISA 
Hey, gang. (THEN) Okay, Bart, this is 
the card catalog.

LISA (CONT'D) 
Let's see, "golf"... Anecdotes, 
fashion, history, humor... ah, here it 
is. Putting. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. LIBRARY STACKS - ORIENTAL PHILOSOPHY SECTION - LATER 


Bart, carrying an arm load of books, is following Lisa. 
Lisa has a list of the books she's looking for. 


LISA 
Ah, here's the most important book of 
all, The Tao Te Ching by Lao Tzu. 
BART 
Okay, that's it! Now I know you're 
just pulling my chain. 


He drops all the books on the floor. People turn and 
stare. 


LISA 
(TO THE OTHERS, EXPLAINING) First 
timer. 
INT. LIBRARY - READING ROOM - LATER 
Bart and Lisa are looking at a large picture book, "Meet 
Mr. Brain". The picture in the book shows an X-ray view of 
a man's brain. An arrow from the left brain points to the 


man as a scientist, an arrow from the right brain points to 
the man as a dancer. 


30. 


TABLE DRAFT 5/23/90 PAGE 31. 


LISA 
(POINTING) The left brain is logical, 
the right brain emotional and artistic. 
Success at any sport requires a 
partnership of the two halves. Each of 
us must do the work of one half the 
brain. 

BART 
So which half am I? 

LISA 
The one in the leotard. 

EXT. LAKE SPRINGFIELD - DAY 


Bart and Lisa sit in the lotus position, facing each other. 
We hear ORIENTAL MUSIC. 


LISA 
I want you to shut off the logical part 
of your mind. 
BART 
Okay. 
LISA 
Embrace nothingness. 
BART 
You got it. 
LISA 
Become like an uncarved stone. 
BART 


Done. 


TABLE DRAFT 5/23/90 PAGE 


LISA 
Bart! You're just pretending to know 
what I'm talking about. 
BART 
True. 
LISA 
Well, it's very frustrating. 
BART 
I'll bet. 
EXT. TOP OF MOUNT SPRINGFIELD = DAY 


The town is spread out before their feet, birds fly below 
them, a gentle wind blows. 


LISA 
Bart, I have a riddle for you: What's 
the sound of one hand clapping? 

BART 
Easy. 


He flaps the fingers of one hand against the palm, making a 
weak CLAPPING noise. 


LISA 
No, Bart. It's a three-thousand-year- 
old riddle with no answer. 

BART 
What're you talking about? Hey, Lisa, 
listen up. 


Bart again flaps the fingers of one hand against his palm, 
making the weak CLAPPING noise. 


32. 


TABLE DRAFT 5/23/90 PAGE 33. 


LISA 
Bart, the riddle is unsolvable. It's 
to clear your mind of conscious 
thought. Let's try another one. 
Listen carefully. If a tree falls in 
the woods and no one's around, does it 
make a sound? 

BART 
Absolutely. Eeeeeeeer! Crash! Boom! 

LISA 
Wait. How can a sound exist if there's 
no one there to hear it? 


For a full five seconds, Bart's face is a complete blank. 
Then it suddenly lights up. 


BART 
Wooooo00cowwwww ! 
Lisa hands Bart the putter. 
LISA 
It is time. 
EXT. MINIATURE GOLF COURSE - DAY 
They're at the hole featuring a statue of a dinosaur with a 
caveman in its mouth. Lisa whips a measuring tape and 
protractor out of her knapsack and takes a few quick 
measurements. 
LISA 
The basis of this game seems to be 
simple geometry. All you have to do is 


hit the ball here. 


TABLE DRAFT 5/23/90 PAGE 34. 


She points to a spot on the sideboard. Bart hits the shot. 
The ball bounces around and rolls right into the hole. 
Bart looks after it, stunned. 
BART 
I can't believe it... You've actually 
found a practical use for geometry. 
They move on to another hole, which features a seated Abe 
Lincoln statue, like at the Lincoln Memorial. Every few 
seconds, Lincoln's legs swing out at the knee in a very 
unnatural way, allowing an opening to hit the ball through. 
Lisa whips out a stopwatch and times it. 
LISA 
When his feet come together, wait five 
seconds and hit the ball. 
BART 
Okay. Onetwothree... 
LISA 
Slower. 
BART 
(EXTREMELY SLOW) One... two... 
LISA 
(TO DEMONSTRATE) One Mississippi, two 
Mississippi... 
BART

counting, sing "The Battle Hymn of the 


Republic". 


TABLE DRAFT 5/23/90 PAGE 35. 


BART 
(SINGS) “Glory, glory, hallelujah / 
Teacher hit me with a ruler / Met her 
at the door with a loaded forty-four / 
And she ain't my teacher no more." 
Bart hits the shot, it goes right through Lincoln's legs. 
LISA 
Yaayy! 
They hug. 
TRAINING MONTAGE 
Over INSPIRATIONAL MUSIC: 


1. At a hole featuring a grinning Sphinx, Lisa makes a 
measurement and points. Bart hits the shot. 


2. Bart hits a shot blindfolded and standing on one leg as 
Lisa observes. 


3. Out a pool hall window, we see it's raining. PAN over 
to show Bart standing on a table, putting balls into a 
corner pocket as Lisa and various LOWLIFES watch. 
Strong hands grab the kids and yank them off the table. 


4. At the course, Lisa wears a raincoat and holds an 
umbrella over Bart so he can continue practicing. 


5. At dusk, we see Bart in silhouette, in the crane 
position (a la "The Karate Kid") atop a garbage can. 


HOMER 
Bart! What're you doing? 
LISA 
He's practicing for the tournament, 


Dad.

HOMER 
Practicing what? How to embarrass your 
father? Get down from there before the 
neighbors see -- 
FLANDERS 
Hey, Simpson. 
Flanders appears on the other side of the fence. 
HOMER 
(ANNOYED GRUNT) Flanders, I don't care 
what this looks like, Bart's gonna mop 
the floor with your son's ugly butt. 
FLANDERS 
(CLINGING TO HIS DECENCY) Well, may 
the best man win. 
HOMER 
Ah, “may the best man win". The mating 
call of the loser. 
FLANDERS 
Now, just a minute, Simpson. I think 
my son has a very good chance. 
HOMER 
Oh, yeah? You wanna bet? 
FLANDERS 
I'm not a betting man. 


Homer makes CLUCKING noises, like a chicken. 


TABLE DRAFT 5/23/90 PAGE 37. 


FLANDERS (CONT'D) 
If that's supposed to mean I'ma 
chicken, you're barking up the wrong 
tree. How's this for a wager? A batch 
of your wife's delicious blueberry 
muffins against one of my wife's 
homemade wind chimes! 

HOMER 
What kinda stupid bet is that? Are you 
scared to make a real bet? 

FLANDERS 
No, I just -- 


Homer makes more CLUCKING noises and dances around, 
flapping his arms. 


FLANDERS (CONT'D) 
You know, Simpson, you're starting to 
annoy me. 

HOMER 
How about this? If Bart wins tomorrow, 
you have to mow my lawn. 

FLANDERS 
And if Todd wins, you have to mow your 
lawn! And do a decent job of it, for a 
change! 

HOMER 
Better yet, you have to mow the lawn in 


your wife's Sunday dress. 


TABLE DRAFT 5/23/90 PAGE 38. 


FLANDERS 
You have yourself a bet, you 
jackaninny! 
INT. SIMPSON KITCHEN - DAY 


Marge is writing on a pad as Homer and Flanders pace back 
and forth. 


HOMER 
Read that back to me, Marge. 

MARGE 
(READS) "The father of the loser mows 
the lawn -- " 

FLANDERS 
(INTERRUPTS) Just a minute. "Loser" 
is such a harsh word. 

HOMER 
You get used to it. 

FLANDERS 
Couldn't we just say "the father of the 
boy who doesn't win"? 

HOMER 
Fine. 

MARGE 
(WRITING) "The father of the boy who 
doesn't win has to mow the lawn in his 
wife's Sunday dress." Now I suppose 
you both have to sign this. I hope 


blood won't be necessary.

HOMER 
I'm game if you are, Flanders. 
Flanders shakes his head and signs the contract. 
EXT. SIMPSON HOUSE - MINUTES LATER 


Flanders storms out carrying the contract. The door SLAMS. 
Flanders stops short. 


FLANDERS 
Good gravy, what have I done? 
INT. CHURCH - REVEREND LOVEJOY'S OFFICE - DAY 


The office displays pictures of LOVEJOY as a young 
basketball and Lacrosse star. 


LOVEJOY 
What's troubling you, Brother Flanders? 
Smothering your children with too much 
love again? 

FLANDERS 
No, Reverend, it's that neighbor of 
mine. He's turned me into a 
foul-mouthed gambler, and possibly a 
cross-dresser. 

LOVEJOY 
Gee, Ned, this sounds serious, but -- 

FLANDERS 
Will you shut up and listen?! 

LOVEJOY 


(GASPS) Ned! 


TABLE DRAFT 5/23/90 PAGE 40. 


FLANDERS 
(REPENTANT) You see what I mean? 
Reverend, I get the feeling he may be 
just a tiny bit jealous of me. 
(INCREASINGLY HEATED) And the more his 
behavior bothers me, the more I want to 
take pleasure in his ineptitude. 

LOVEJOY 
Yes, back in seminary, a student was 
jealous of my... well, let's just say I 
had more on the beam. But rather than 
savor my superiority, I reached out to 
him in a spirit of Christian 
fellowship, and today we're the best of 
friends. 


Lovejoy indicates a photo of himself, arm-in-arm with 
another Reverend. 


LOVEJOY (CONT'D) 
He's the pastor at Second Presbyterian. 
(SNICKERS) A wee little church for a 
wee little man. 

FLANDERS 
So you think if I reach out in the same 
spirit to Homer... 

LOVEJOY 
Homer? Homer Simpson? 

FLANDERS 


Yes. 


TABLE DRAFT 5/23/90 PAGE 41. 


LOVEJOY 
Ned, he's a member of my flock. 
FLANDERS 
Yes. 
LOVEJOY 
He annoys everyone. Without getting 
into particulars, it's clear to me that 
you're in no way to blame. 
FLANDERS 
But, Reverend, it takes two to tango. 
LOVEJOY 
Trust me. 
FLANDERS 
And what about the bet? 
LOVEJOY 
Take hin. 
EXT. MINIATURE GOLF COURSE ~ DAY 


Homer pulls up and sees Bart and Lisa practicing on a 
pirate pig hole. He HONKS the horn. 


HOMER 
Hey, Bart, how's it goin', champ? 
Let's see that winning forn. 
Bart becomes visibly nervous. 
HOMER (CONT'D) 
Keep your left arm straight... rotate 
your shoulders... 
BART 


Dad! 


TABLE DRAFT 5/23/90 PAGE 42. 


HOMER 
(GENTLY) Look, son, all I'm asking is 
that you try. 
BART 
Okay, I'll try. 
HOMER 
(SCORNFUL) Anybody can try! I want 
you to win! Give me a swelled head! I 
never had one! 
Bart stabs at the ball. It bounces off the pig and 
SPLASHES into the lagoon. CLOSE ON Homer, who looks 
worried. 
INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM =~ NIGHT 
Marge is putting her hair in curlers at the vanity table. 
Homer reaches into her closet and pulls out two dresses, 
one with polka dots and one with vertical stripes. He 
holds them up in front of the mirror. 
MARGE 
Homer?! 
HOMER 
Marge, give me your honest opinion.

Bart is asleep. He stirs, opens his eyes and SCREAMS. We 
PULL OUT revealing that Homer is still sitting beside him 
on the bed. 
HOMER 
Just another day. Nothing to get 
nervous about. No big tournament... 
Oh, wait a minute. There is a big 
tournament and you're in it! And you 
better win! 
Lisa runs in. 
LISA 
Dad! Please leave! 
HOMER 
See you downstairs, boy. There's a 
hearty steak and eggs breakfast 


awaitin' you. 


TABLE DRAFT 5/23/90 PAGE 44. 


Homer exits. 
LISA 
How are you feeling? 
BART 
(MISERABLY) Okay. 


Bart gets out of bed, walks into the bathroom and begins 
washing up over the following. 


LISA 
Eighth hole. 

BART 
(AUTOMATICALLY) Aim for the Octopus' 
third tentacle, allow for six inches of

LISA 
Twelfth hole. 

BART 
Bank it off the pink tombstone, don't

HOMER 
Heh heh... that crazy Marmaduke... 
Marge sets the plate of steak and eggs before Bart. 
MARGE 
Here you go, Bart. A lumberjack's 
breakfast. 
LISA 
Mom, Bart is ona strict diet of 
complex carbohydrates. Steak will make 
him logy. 
MARGE 


Well, what won't make him logy? 


LISA 
Oatmeal. 

HOMER 
Oatmeal? 

LISA 


Oats are what a champion thoroughbred 
eats before he or she wins the Kentucky 
Derby. 

HOMER 
News flash, Lisa! Bart isn't a horse. 
Eat your steak, boy. 

BART 
Aw, forget it! I'm not hungry. 


Bart slumps into the living roon.

LISA 
Dad, do you know what the biggest 
obstacle is to Bart playing well? 
HOMER 
That kangaroo statue where you got to 
hit it in the tiny little pouch? 
LISA 
No. You are. 
HOMER 
(GASPS) Me?? That was my next guess. 
LISA 
You've staked this entire family's 
self-esteem on the shoulders of a ten- 
year-old boy. The only way he can win 
is if you tell him it's okay to lose. 
HOMER 
But if I tell him to lose, he'll lose. 
LISA 
No, Dad. If you tell him to win, he'll 
lose. 
HOMER 
Lisa, there's a lot of things I haven't 
understood in my life: One of them is 
everything you just said... Okay, I'll 
talk to him, but you better be right. 
INT. SIMPSON HOUSE = LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 


Bart is sullenly watching TV as Homer approaches.

HOMER 
Watching TV instead of thinking about 
the tournament, eh? Good, good. 
Because that tournament is not so 
important -- 

BART 
(EXPLODING) Homer, would you shut up 
about the tournament, already! Why are 
you so obsessed with it? You're crazy! 
Name me one athlete who got famous 
playing a sport with the word 
"miniature" in it, To hell with the 
tournament! I don't care about the 
stupid tournament! 

Bart storms out past Lisa.

BRITISH COMMENTATOR 
Good afternoon, everybody, and welcome 
to the finale of what has already been 
a stirring afternoon of miniature golf. 
The cream has risen, the wheat has bid 
farewell to the chaff, we now approach 
the championship match with but two 
warriors remaining: The heretofore 
unknown Bart Simpson, and Todd 
Flanders, one of the most skilled ten 
year olds ever to take back the blade. 
NEW ANGLE 
Bart conferring with Lisa. 
LISA 
Bart, having never received any words 
of encouragement myself, I'm not sure 
how they're supposed to sound. But 
here goes. I believe in you. 
BART 
Thanks, man! 
EXT. MINIATURE GOLF COURSE = CONTINUOUS 
Homer and Marge, carrying Maggie, approach the Flanders 
clan, who have their heads bowed in prayer. Todd is 
wearing a snappy golfcap and plaid knickers. 
HOMER 
Hey, Flanders, it's no use praying, 
because I already did the same thing, 


and we can't both win. 


TABLE DRAFT 5/23/90 PAGE 49. 


FLANDERS. 
(THROUGH CLENCHED TEETH) Actually, 
Simpson, we were praying that no one 
gets hurt. 

HOMER 
Oh... Well, it doesn't matter. This 


time tomorrow, you'll be wearing high 


heels. 

FLANDERS 
No, you will.

EXT. MINIATURE GOLF - FIRST HOLE - CONTINUOUS 
Polite APPLAUSE as Todd and Bart approach the first tee. 
BRITISH COMMENTATOR 
Young Flanders has the honor and will 
tee off first. 


Todd sticks out his hand, Bart shakes it without 
enthusiasm. 


TODD 
Good luck, Bart. 

BART 
Get bent. 


Todd tees up and hits the ball through the boxing 
alligator's legs. 


BRITISH COMMENTATOR (V.O.) 
It's got a chance... (BALL GOES IN) 
Yes, sir! 
BART 
(DESPAIRINGLY) Oh, man... 
Bart talks to himself as he tees up. 
BART 
(TO HIMSELF) Tree falling in the 
woods. Tree falling in the woods. 
Tree falling in the... 


A glazed, slack-jawed expression comes over Bart. He putts 
and sinks it. The crowd APPLAUDS. 


TABLE DRAFT 5/23/90 PAGE 51. 


BRITISH COMMENTATOR (V.0.) 
And the battle is well and truly

Woo-hoo! (TO FLANDERS) Stick that in 
your pipe, Mister Put-on-women's- 
clothing-and-mow-the-grass-in-front-of- 
a-bunch-of people! (BEAT) Oh, and smoke 
at! 
FLANDERS 
(TO TODD) Mercy is for the weak, Todd. 
Todd does not look happy with the change in his dad. 
MONTAGE 
Bart and Todd tensely hitting shots on some of the goofy 
holes we've seen or heard described. We see their 
respective families CHEER when a putt is sunk, anguish when 
it misses. It appears to be a close match.

If one were to look up "courage" in the 
dictionary, one might very well come 
upon a photo of these two gladiators. 
They approach the final hole deadlocked 
at eight strokes on the happy side of 
par. Soon, one man will emerge 
triumphant, he will drink naught but 
champagne, while his opponent tastes 
bitter defeat in this often cruel game. 
Todd putts. The ball rolls through Lincoln's legs and 
emerges three feet from the hole. The CROWD APPLAUDS 
politely. 
FLANDERS 
It's okay, son. You can recover. 
NEW ANGLE 
Homer is a nervous wreck. 
HOMER

Bart is taking deep breaths. 


TABLE DRAFT 5/23/90 PAGE 53. 


BART 
(TO HIMSELF) This is it, dude. (SINGS 
IN ANGUISHED VOICE) "Glory, glory, 
hallelujah / Teacher hit me with a 
ruler / Met her at the door / with a 
loaded forty-four / and she's no longer 
teaching at my school anymore... Uh-oh. 
Bart putts. It barely makes it through Lincoln's legs. He 
SIGHS with relief and mops his brow. Bart and Todd both 
have three foot putts to make. 
BRITISH COMMENTATOR 
Neither man showing his best form... 
This sort of pressure can unhinge even 
the steeliest competitor. 
TODD 
This is pretty tense, isn't it, Bart? 
BART 
Well, maybe for you. 
TODD 
You mean you're not nervous? Your 
knees aren't shaking. You don't 
realize that the slightest mistake can 
brand you a loser? 
BART 
Oh, that. Yeah, I got plenty of that. 
TODD 
Well, I guess there's no turning back 


now. 


TABLE DRAFT 5/23/90 PAGE 54. 


BART 
Sure there is. We could quit. 
TODD 
Hey! 
WIDE SHOT 
Bart and Todd pick up their balls and cross to the scoring 
table where the JUDGE and the BRITISH COMMENTATOR are 
sitting. 
TODD 
We've decided we're equally good. 
BART 
Yeah, we want to call it a draw. 
BRITISH COMMENTATOR 
(ANNOUNCING) Ladies and gentlemen, we 
have a draw! 


The crowd MURMURS, "A draw!" "What the hell is that?" "A 
draw in miniature golf!" "This is ridiculous." 


BRITISH COMMENTATOR (CONT'D) 
(TEARFULLY) You will forgive an old 
Brit for crying, but this is the most 
stirring display of gallantry and 
sportsmanship since Mountbatten gave 
India back to the Punjabs. 
EXT. MINIATURE GOLF COURSE - DUSK 


Bart and Todd exchange a high five, HOLLERING "Yipee!" and 
"Yeah!". 


NEW ANGLE 


Flanders puts a friendly hand on Homer's shoulder. 


TABLE DRAFT 5/23/90 PAGE 55. 


FLANDERS 
Well, Homer, our kids showed us 
something today. By working together, 
we can both be winners. (CHUCKLES) 
Thank heaven neither of us has to go 
through with that silly wager. 

HOMER 
Wait a minute, Flanders! You're not 
gonna welch on our bet?! 

FLANDERS 
What are you talking about? Neither of 
our boys lost. 

HOMER 
I got it right here in writing. 

Homer takes the contract out of his pocket. 

HOMER (CONT'D) 
(READING) "The father of the boy who 
doesn't win has to mow the lawn dressed 
in his wife's Sunday dress." 

FLANDERS 
(DISBELIEVING) You mean you want us 
both to do it?! 

HOMER 
That's right, Flanders. Wearing a 
dress is a small price to pay to see 


you humiliate yourself. 


TABLE DRAFT 5/23/90 PAGE 56. 


EXT. SIMPSON AND FLANDERS HOUSES = DAY 

Homer and Flanders, wearing their wives' Sunday dresses and 
hats, pass each other as they mow the their lawns. 

LAUGHING NEIGHBORS shout jeering AD LIB8: "Nice legs", "Woo 
woo", "You missed a spot," etc. 


We see Bart, Lisa and Todd, Maggie, Rod, Todd, Maude and 
Marge watching the scene. 


MARGE 
(MOANING) Oh, my best dress. 
LISA 
Why do I get the feeling that someday 
I'll be describing this to a 
psychiatrist? 
CLOSE-UP - HOMER 
Muttering to himself. 
HOMER 
Listen to them laughing... This is so 
humiliating... I'm never gonna live 
this down... Damn Flanders... 
Homer approaches the fence at the same time Flanders does. 
FLANDERS 
¥'know, Simpson, this is kind of fun! 
Reminds me of my fraternity days. 
HOMER 
(ANNOYED GRUNT) Oh my God! He's 
enjoying it! 
FADE OUT: 


THE END

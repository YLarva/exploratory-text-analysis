ACT ONE 
FADE IN: 
INT. SIMPSON BATHROOM - MORNING 
LISA stands at the mirror, motionless. She sadly stares at 
her reflection. A clock TICKS loudly, 0.S. It is an 
Ingmar Bergman moment. Lisa SIGHS. Suddenly, there is a 
loud BANGING at the door, which buckles slightly. 
SPX: BANG BANG BANG 
HOMER (V.O.) 
(ANGRILY) Lisa, Lisa, are you still in 
there? What's the problem? Did you 
fall in? (CHUCKLE) Lisa! 
LISA 
(SIGHS) 
EXT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS 
HOMER stands in his ZFL Football pajamas, outside the door, 
as Lisa silently exits past him. Suddenly, BART zips by 
Homer into the bathroon. 


BART 


Sorry, Dad. Women and children first.

HOMER 
Wha - th... 

BART (V.0.) 
(CHUCKLES) 


Homer starts BANGING his fists against the bathroom door. 
Lisa shakes her head and silently exits out of frame. 


INT. KITCHEN - A LITTLE LATER 
CLOSE UP of Lisa, staring ahead blankly. PULL BACK to see 
she is sitting in the eye of the Simpson hurricane. Homer 
tears up the kitchen like a madman -- SLAMMING open 
cabinets, checking under the toaster, picking up Maggie out 
of her highchair and checking under her, etc. Bart tags 
along, enjoying the spectacle, eating cereal from a bowl. 
MARGE HUMS while she makes their lunches. 
HOMER 
Where the hell are my keys? Who stole 
my keys? Come on, I'm late for work. 
MARGE 
Oh Homer, you'd lose your head if it 
weren't securely fastened to your neck. 
Homer GROANS in frustration. 
BART 
Did you check the den? 
HOMER 


The den! Great idea! 


Homer tears off into the den. Bart follows him, strolling 
casually, carrying the bowl of cereal. 


INT. DEN 


Homer rummaging through couch, tossing cushions. We see 
lots of old junk, but not the keys. 


FINAL DELIVERY OCTOBER 3, 1989 PAGE 


BART 
(EATING) Warm... no, cold... colder... 
Ice cold. 
HOMER 
Do you know where my keys are? 
BART 
No. I'm talking about your breakfast. 
(LAUGHS) . 
Homer GROWLS and advances on Bart ominously. 
BART 
Did you try the rumpus room? 
HOMER 
Rumpus room. Great idea! 


Homer tears out of den toward the rumpus room. Bart 
follows with his cereal. 


INT. FOYER 


Lisa crosses and opens the front door, revealing a set of 
keys still in the lock. 


LISA 
Oh Dad... 
Lisa points to the keys in the lock. 
HOMER (CONT'D) 
(GROANS) 
Bart and Maggie APPLAUD. 
LISA 
(WEARY) Here. 


Lisa hands Homer the keys. Marge walks into the fray, 
HUMMING, carrying three bag lunches but only two cupcakes. 


FINAL DELIVERY OCTOBER 3, 1989 PAGE 


MARGE 
I'm sorry, everybody. I don't know how 
to break this to you all, but I've only 
got two cupcakes for the three of you. 
BART 
Well, Mom, one of us has scarfed down 
more than enough cupcakes over the past 
three decades to keep him... 
HOMER 
Bart! 
LISA 
Just take mine. A simple cupcake will 
bring me no pleasure. 
Bart and Homer give each other high fives. 
BART 
Yeah! 
HOMER 
All right. Hey, hey! 
MARGE 
Thank you, Lisa. Just for being so 
nice, I'll give you an extra celery 
stick. 
Lisa SIGHS. Marge hands out the lunches. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. STREET - MORNING 
MRS. GROSS, the grumpy school crossing guard, sits in a 


chair at the corner across from school. She turns to see a 
bunch of KIDS staring at her, including Lisa and Bart. 


FINAL DELIVERY OCTOBER 3, 1989 PAGE 5. 


MRS. GROSS 
What is it? 
BART 
We want to cross the street. ma'am. 
MRS. GROSS 
So cross the street! What do you want 
me to do -- hold your hand? 
LISA 
Mrs. Gross, there's a bunch of cars 
coming right this way. 
MRS. GROSS 
Don't tell me how to do-my job. All 
right. Just scoot, okay, just scoot! 
She WHAPS Lisa on the behind with her Stop sign. The 
children all cross the street as a bunch of cars race 
through the intersection. Cars SCREECH to a halt and 
swerve to avoid kids. SFX: HORN HONKING, SCREECHING 
TIRES. The children race across, dodging traffic, and come 
to rest on the opposite corner GASPING for breath. The 
kids happily hug and shake hands and AD LIB: "Yeah", "We 
made it". 
KIDS 
(HAPPILY) Whew! We made it! 
BART 
We're safe! 
LISA 
(SOMBERLY) Oh, Bart. Are any of us 
ever truly safe? 
BART 
Huh? 


She walks off.

INT. MUSIC CLASS =- A LITTLE LATER 
Lisa sits, holding her baritone sax, with the rest of the 
school orchestra. The prissy music teacher, MR. LARGO, 
leads them. 
MR. LARGO 
All right, class, from the top. One 


and two and... three and four. 


The ORCHESTRA BEGINS an off-key, plodding rendition of "My 
Country 'Tis of Thee". Mr. Largo conducts. 


The ORCHESTRA SLOGS through the next two lines of the song. 
Then at the break after "Of Thee I Sing," Lisa cuts loose 
with an improvised jazz solo. MUSIC: IMPRESSIVE BARITONE 
SAX SOLO. The rest of the orchestra falls silent and 
stares at her. 
MR. LARGO (CONT'D) 
Lisa... 
Lisa keeps PLAYING, in a rapture. 
MR. LARGO (CONT'D) 
Lisa Simpson! 
Lisa stops playing. 
MR. LARGO (CONT'D) 
Lisa, there's no room for crazy bebop 
in "My Country 'Tis Of Thee." 
LISA 
But, Mr. Largo, that's what my 
country's all about. 
MR. LARGO 


What? 


FINAL DELIVERY OCTOBER 3, 1989 PAGE 7. 


LISA 
I'm wailing out for the homeless family 
living out of its car. The Iowa farmer 
whose land has been taken away by 
unfeeling bureaucrats. The West 
Virginia coal miner, coughing up his... 
MR. LARGO 
Well, that's all fine and good, but 
Lisa, none of those unpleasant people 
are going to be at the recital next 
week. 
Lisa looks embarrassed. 
MR. LARGO (CONT'D) 
Now, class. From the top. Five, six, 
seven... 


The class begins its FEEBLE RENDITION of "My Country 'Tis 
Of Thee" from the top. Lisa looks miserable. 


INT. LUNCHROOM - LATER THAT DAY 
The CHILDREN are eating. Lisa sits at a table with her 
friend JANEY, and several other GIRLS. Lisa does not eat 
but grimly surveys the scene around her. 
LISA 

Every day at noon a bell rings and they 

herd us in here for feeding time. And 

we sit around like cattle, chewing our 

cuds, dreading the inevitable... 
Across the lunchroom, Bart stands up. 


BART 
(HOLLERING HAPPILY) Food fight! 


FINAL DELIVERY OCTOBER 3, 1989 PAGE 


The lunchroom erupts in a huge food fight. Kids AD LIB: 
"Bull's-eye," "Gotcha," "Gross," Yuck," "Who did that?" 
"Gimme that gelatin," "Not with my pudding, you don't.." 


JANEY 
C'mon, Lis, what are you waiting for? 
Chuck that spaghetti! 


A huge glob of mashed potatoes HITS Lisa in the face. SFX: 
FWOP. Lisa wipes mashed potatoes away sadly. 


INT. EXERCISE ROOM - LATER THAT DAY 


Lisa and the other girls are in gym suits. Several of the 
girls hold large rubber balls. The gym teacher, MISS BARR, 
addresses them. She BLOWS her WHISTLE. All the girls but 
Lisa start throwing balls at each other in a heated game of 
Dodge Ball. Everyone is dodging but Lisa, who stands, 
nearly catatonic. She gets hit with one ball after 
another, and finally by several balls at once. Miss Barr 
BLOWS the WHISTLE and the game abruptly stops. 


MISS BARR 


Lisa, we are playing dodge ball here. 


The object of the game is to avoid the 
ball by weaving or ducking out of its 
path. 

LISA 
In other words, to dodge the ball. 

MISS BARR 
Listen, Missy, just tell me why you 
weren't getting out of the way of those 
balls. 

LISA 


I'm too sad. 


FINAL DELIVERY OCTOBER 3, 1989 PAGE 9. 


MISS BARR 
Too sad to play dodge ball? That's 
ridiculous. Now, let's see some 


enthusiasm! Play ball! 


Kids YELL with enthusiasm. Miss Barr BLOWS her WHISTLE. 
Fifty balls come flying at Lisa. She does not move and 


pounded by dozens of balls. 


DISSOLVE TO: 


INT. SIMPSON LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON 


Bart and Homer sit at the TV, about to play a Nintendo- 
style video boxing game. SFX: TINNY VIDEO GAME THEME. 


HOMER 
Come on, come on. Let's go. 

BART 
In the red trunks, with a record of 
forty-eight wins and no losses, the 
undisputed champ of this house, 
Battling Bart Simpson. (WHISTLES) 
Whoopee! Whoo! Whoo! And in the 
lavender trunks, with a record of zero 
wins and forty-eight defeats -- oh, 
correction, humiliating defeats -- all 
of them by knockout... 

HOMER 
(QUIET DIGNITY) Must you do this every 
time? 

BART

FINAL DELIVERY OCTOBER 3, 1989 PAGE 10. 


The game begins. Bart plays with cool aplomb, while Homer 
plays in a frenzy. The BOXERS meet in the middle of the 
screen. Bart knocks Homer's Little Boxer down with one 
PUNCH. SFX: VIDEO GAME "OOF." 
HOMER 
Get up (GRUNT) Wait a minute. 
Don't...Wait. 
BART 
And Homer is down! (LAUGHS) 
HOMER 


That wasn't supposed to happen. 


BART 

Three seconds, folks -- a new record! 
HOMER 

Oh no! I'm not down, I'm -- Get up, 


you! Get up! Come on. 


Homer's Little Boxer gets up, his eye swollen shut. The 


intensity and gore of the fight is reminiscent of Raging 
Bull. 


HOMER (CONT'D) 
Okay. Here we go. 

BART 
Yo, chump, you back again? 


Bart flattens Homer's Little Boxer with one PUNCH again. 
SFX: "OOF". Bart gives a triumphant CHUCKLE. Homer's 
Little Boxer gets up, dazed and wobbling. Both of his eyes 
are swollen shut. Homer GROANS. AD LIBS: "Oooh". "Stop", 
“What's wrong with this thing?" "Hey." 


Bart's Little Boxer pushes Homer's boxer against the ropes 
and starts to throw a flurry of viscious PUNCHES. Blood 
sprays from Homer's eyes. Marge and Lisa enter the roon, 
as Homer's Little Boxer struggles to his feet. He's a 
mess, with animated blood trickling from his nose. 


FINAL DELIVERY OCTOBER 3, 1989 PAGE 11. 


HOMER 
(GRUNT) Get out of the way. How come 
he's not ducking. Ugh! Wait a minute, 
I can't get my... Get out of the way, 
stupid. 
MARGE 
Homer? 
HOMER 
(CONCENTRATING) Not now, Marge. 
Bart's Little Boxer is PUMMELING Homer's Little Boxer's 
head like a punching bag. The head vibrates back and forth 
on its skinny neck. 
HOMER (CONT'D) 
Ohhh...get out of the corner. 
MARGE 
But they sent a note from school. 
Marge holds out note for Homer to read. 
HOMER 
(CONCENTRATING) What did you do this 
time, you little hoodlum? Oop. Get 
out of the way. Ugh! 
BART 
I didn't do it. Nobody saw me do it. 
There's no way they can prove anything. 
MARGE 
No, Bart. This note isn't about you. 
BART 


It isn't? There must be some mistake. 


FINAL DELIVERY OCTOBER 3, 1989 PAGE 12. 


Bart takes note and reads it, holding it in one hand, as he 
casually continues the BEATING of Homer with the other. 


BART (CONT'D) 
Hey, you're right. This note's about 
Lisa. 
Homer looks up, shocked. 
HOMER 
“Lisa? 
Bart's Little Boxer gives Homer's Little Boxer one last 
WALLOP. Homer's Little Boxer's head goes flying off, as 
the body keels over. The head rolls to a stop, grotesquely 


resting in front of the screen. SFX: VIDEO GAME 
RENDITION OF "TAPS." Bart CHUCKLES.

ACT TWO 


FADE IN: 
INT. SIMPSON LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON 
The family watches as Homer reads Lisa's note from school. 
HOMER 
(READING) "Lisa refuses to play dodge 
ball because she is sad." (PAUSE) 
Now, Lisa, tell me the truth. Why 
wouldn't you play dodge ball? 
LISA 
Because I was sad. 
HOMER 
Well, cheer up! 
MARGE 
Homer, I don't think that's going to 
work. 
HOMER 
Well, she doesn't look sad. (PEERING 
CLOSELY AT LISA) I don't see any tears 


in her eyes. 


FINAL DELIVERY OCTOBER 3, 1989 PAGE 


LISA 
It's not that kind of sad. I'm sorry, 
Dad, but you wouldn't understand. 
HOMER 
Oh, sure I would, Princess. I have 
feelings too. You know, like "my 
stomach hurts," or "I'm going crazy." 
Why don't you climb up on Daddy's knee 
and tell him all about it? 
Lisa climbs on Homer's knee and looks him deep in the eyes. 
LISA 
I'm just wondering what's the point? 
Would it make any difference at all if 
I never existed? How can we sleep at 
night when there's so much suffering in 
the world? 
Homer stares blankly. 
HOMER 
Well... eh. Er... 
Desperate, Homer starts bouncing Lisa on his knee. 
HOMER (CONT'D) 
Come on, Lisa... ride the Homer horsey. 
Giddiyap! Whee! Hi, ho, Lisa. 
(CHUCKLES) 


He stops and examines her hopefully. Lisa is still sad.

MARGE 
Lisa, Honey, why don't we go upstairs 
and I'll draw you a nice hot bath? 
That helps me when I feel sad. 
LISA 
Sorry, Dad. I know you mean well. 
She gives him a kiss and climbs off his knee. 
HOMER 
(TO LISA) Thanks for knowing I mean 
well. 
Lisa and Marge exit. Homer looks shocked. 
BART 
Gee, Homer. Looks like you got 
yourself a real problem on your hands. 
You better do something. 
HOMER 
You're right. Bart, vacuum this floor! 
BART 
Hey man, I didn't do anything wrong. 
HOMER 
In times of trouble, you got to go with 
what you know. Now hop to it, boy!

INT. LIVING ROOM - A LITTLE LATER 


Bart angrily struggles with an upright vacuum cleaner that 
is taller than he is. Maggie sits on the couch watching. 


FINAL DELIVERY OCTOBER 3, 1989 PAGE 16. 


BART 
(GRUMBLES) Stupid Homer... (MUMBLES) 
Thinks he's so big... .Homer... 
Homer... Homer. 
Bart vacuums carelessly, sucking up everything in his path: 
a bedroom slipper, a ball of yarn which quickly unravels, 
some jacks which CLATTER up the vacuum tube, etc. With 
each push, Bart SLAMS the vacuum into the wall, cracking 
the paint at the baseboard. 
Bart JAMS the vacuum under the end table and a deck of 
cards falls off the table, scattering on the floor. Bart 
looks around, then noisily vacuums up the cards, which 
quickly fly into the tube one at a time. SFX: FWAP FWAP 
FWAP FWAP FWAP. Lisa enters, wrapped in a towel and 
brushing her (wet) hair. 
BART 
(MAD) Enjoy your bath? 
LISA 
No. Not really. 
BART 
(SARCASTIC) Oh. Too bad. Well I 
certainly had fun vacuuming. Maybe now 
I'll get the pleasure of scrubbing your 
tub. 
LISA 
(TO MAGGIE) So typical of Bart. All 
he thinks about is himself. 
BART 
Hey, don't say stuff like that about me 
to Maggie. She's on my side anyway. 


LISA 


Is not.

BART 
Is too. 

LISA 
Is not. 

BART 
Is too. 

LISA 
Is not. 

BART 


Is too. Watch, I'll prove it. Maggie, 
come to the one you love best. 
Maggie hops off the couch and crawls towards Bart. 
LISA 
(DRAGGED INTO IT) No, Maggie! 
(BECKONING) Come here, girl. Come to 
me. 
Maggie starts to veer towards Lisa. 
P.O.V. > MAGGIE 
It is the LOW-ANGLE FISH-EYE perspective of a baby. She 
turns to Bart, his beckoning fingers filling the 
foreground. 
BART 
Come on, Maggie. The choice is 
obvious. 
P.O.V. = LISA 
LISA 
No, Maggie, don't go for the glitter. 


Look for substance.

Maggie zig-zags between the beckoning Lisa and Bart. 
LISA (CONT'D) 
Maggie, just go to the one you love 
most. 
Maggie heads straight between Lisa and Bart, for the TV 
behind them. She switches it on and SUCKS happily. 
SFX: CARTOON MUSIC. On screen, SCRATCHY, a cartoon cat, is 
strapped in an electric chair. ITCHY, a mouse, throws the 
switch and the cat fries gruesomely.

INT. LIVING ROOM - THAT NIGHT 
CLOSEUP - TELEVISION SCREEN 
Another video boxing match is taking place, with Bart's 
Little Boxer PUMMELING Homer's Little Boxer, who is already 
battered and bleeding.

Oh no, come on! Don't let that boy -- 
get out of the...Oh no, not again! 
Don't Don't. Don't. Geat, get over. 
Oh geeze. 
CUT WIDER to see Homer straining and gyrating and going 
berserk as Bart stifles a yawn. Suddenly, Bart and Homer 
hear SAXOPHONE MUSIC coming from upstairs. SFX: BLUES ON 
SAX. 
Bart's Boxer finishes off Homer's Little Boxer. He's out 
cold in the middle of the ring. The REFEREE counts him 
out. The Referee shakes him trying to revive him, and then 
he shakes his own head. The VIDEO IMAGE CUTS to Homer's 
Little Boxer in an open casket being lowered into a grave. 
Bart's Little Boxer dances in triumph nearby. 
BART 


Gee, Dad, you're really bad at this.

that infernal racket . (CALLING) 
Lisa! Lisa! 
Homer gets up to talk to Lisa. 
INT. LISA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS 


Lisa sits in a window seat, sadly playing the BLUES on her 
BARITONE SAX. After a beat, Homer enters. 


HOMER 
(ANGRY) Lisa, what did I tell you 
about playing that saxamathing in the 
house. 

LISA 
(SADLY) I was just playing the blues, 
(PAUSE), Dad. 


She starts to WHIMPER. Homer immediately turns to mush. 
His knees shake. 


HOMER 
Lisa, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to 
yell. Go ahead -- play your blues if 
it'll make you happy. 

LISA 
No, that's okay, Dad. (SNIFFS) I'll 
just work on my fingering. Unless my 
fingers clacking on the keys is too 


loud for you. 


FINAL DELIVERY OCTOBER 3, 1989 PAGE 20. 


HOMER 

(SINCERE) Let's hear it. (LISA CLACKS 

FINGERS ON SAX) You just clack as loud 

as you want. 
He edges out of the room and shuts the door gingerly. Lisa 
fingers her saxophone without blowing. As she plays, 
Lisa's silent song grows in intensity. Suddenly, off in 
the distance, we HEAR SAXOPHONE MUSIC. SFX: DISTANT 
SAXOPHONE BLUES. 
Lisa pulls the sax out of her mouth, but the MUSIC 
CONTINUES. Puzzled, she runs to the window, opens it, and 
the MUSIC GROWS LOUDER. Carrying her saxophone, Lisa 
climbs out of her second-story bedroom window, leaps onto a 
nearby tree branch, and climbs down the treehouse ladder. 
EXT. SIMPSON'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 
Lisa begins walking down the street. 
EXT. STREET - ANOTHER AREA - NIGHT 


Lisa passes Berger's Burgers and Howard's Flowers, both of 
which are closed. 


EXT. STREET - ANOTHER AREA - NIGHT 
The SAX MUSIC is a LITTLE LOUDER. Lisa passes a series of 
storefronts with garish blinking neon lights: "MOE'S 
TAVERN", "TATTOOS", "MASSAGE PARLOR", and a sleazy movie 
theatre. On the marquee a sign reads "KRUSTY THE KLOWN in 
PARDON MY NOSE -- RATED X". 
EXT. BRIDGE - NIGHT 
The MUSIC is LOUDER than ever. Lisa sees it is coming from 
the sax of BLEEDING GUMS MURPHY, an aged musician who plays 
under a streetlight on the bridge. He stops playing. 
LISA 
That was beautiful. What's it called? 
MURPHY 
It's a little tune that I call the "I 


Never Had An Italian Suit Blues."

HOMER'S LITTLE BOXER 
Just bring him a drink, okay, Moe? And

MOE 
Yeah. All right, Shorty. 

HOMER 
(TO LITTLE BOXER) You shouldn't be 
drinking. You're in training. 

HOMER'S LITTLE BOXER 
No, I ain't. They took my license 
away. They said if I fight any more I 
could develop brain damage. 

HOMER 
Ooooh, brain damage. Don't want to get 
that. 


Moe sets a drink down in front of Homer, who downs it in 
one gulp. 


HOMER 
So what are you going to do now that 


you're retired?

Lisa is PLAYING the BLUES on her BARITONE SAXOPHONE, while 
jazzman Bleeding Gums Murphy nods and listens. 


MURPHY 
(AS SHE PLAYS) Now -- low B-flat. 
Lisa's MUSIC drops an octave to PLAY a difficult LOW NOTE. 
MURPHY (CONT') 
Okay, Lisa -- altissimo register. 


Lisa's MUSIC jumps up two octaves. Her eyes bulge as she 
plays one last very high note. 


MURPHY (CONT'D) 
Very nice, very nice. I once ruptured 
myself doing that. 
LISA 
Thanks, Mr. Murphy- 
MURPHY 
My friends call me Bleeding Gums. 
LISA 
Ew! How'd you get a name like that? 
MURPHY 
Well, let me put it this way. You ever 
been to the dentist? 
LISA 
Yeah. 
MURPHY 
Not me. I suppose I should go to one, 
but I got enough pain in my life as it 


is.

LISA 
I have problems, too. 

MURPHY 
Well, I can't help you, kid. I'm just 
a terrific horn player with tons of 
soul. But I can jam with you. 

LISA 
Okay. 


Murphy starts to PLAY the BLUES. Lisa joins in. They play 
several bars together, then Murphy starts to SING. 


MURPHY 
(SINGING) I'm so lonely, since my baby 
left me. I got no money, and nothing 
is free. I been so lonely, since the 
day I was born. All I got is this 
rusty - this rusty old horn. 
Murphy resumes PLAYING his 8Ax. 
LISA 
(SINGING) I got a bratty brother. He 
bugs me every day. And this mornin' my 
own mother gave my last cupcake away! 
My Dad acts like he belongs... he 
belongs in the zoo. I'm the sa...dest 
kid in grade number two. 
They both PLAY a big finish, then stop. 
MURPHY 
You know, you play pretty well for 


someone with no real problems. 


FINAL DELIVERY OCTOBER 3, 1989 PAGE 27. 


LISA 
Yeah, but I don't feel any better. 
MURPHY 
The blues isn't about feeling better. 
It's about making other people feel 
worse and making a few bucks while 
you're at it. Which reminds me, if 
you're ever in the neighborhood, I'n 
playing at a little club called the 
Jazz Hole... 
Marge drives up. 
MARGE 
“Lisa, get away from that jazzman! 
LISA 
But Mom, can't I -- stay a little 
longer. 
MARGE 
Come on, come on. We were worried 
about you. (TO MURPHY) Nothing 
personal. I just fear the unfamiliar. 
Lisa gets in the car. Murphy starts PLAYING the SAXOPHONE.

Homer walks up to a building labeled "RAIDERS OF THE LOST

nobody sees him, then ducks inside. 
INT. VIDEO ARCADE - CONTINUOUS 
Homer enters to see various exotic video games including 
PAC-RAT, NUCLEAR WINTER, ITCHY VS. SCRATCHY, and ESCAPE 
FROM GRANDMA'S HOUSE. He looks around and realizes he is 
the only person over age 12 in the whole place, except for 
the cashier, who sits in a little glass booth. Homer 
approaches hin.

Gimme some quarters. (COVERING) I'm 
doing my laundry.

Homer hands him a bill and the cashier gives him a big bag 
of quarters. Homer takes a quick look around the arcade 
and returns to Cashier. 
HOMER 
(LOW) Where's the video boxing? 
CASHIER (OVER MICROPHONE) 
It's over there in the corner, but if I 
were you, I really would use those 
quarters for laundry. 
Homer GROWLS, and crosses to the video boxing machine, 
passing a game labeled ROBERT GOULET DESTROYER (we hear a 
MAN SING "I Gotta Be Me" followed by an EXPLOSION). He 
arrives at the video boxing machine which has a LARGE CROWD 
OF KIDS hanging around it. TWO BOYS are playing the game. 
One of them, a cool kid in sunglasses, is the CHAMP. He 
plays one-handed while drinking a milkshake, and is winning 
with ease. 
HOMER 
(RE: CHAMP) Hey, that kid's pretty 
good. 
BOY ONLOOKER 
Good? Are you kidding? Over two 
thousand fights, and he's still on his 
original quarter. 


The Champ effortlessly knocks out his opponent, then turns 
to the crowd.

Okay? Who's next?

The Champ backs away from the machine.

That's okay. With the tips you've 
given me, I'm going to pound the tar 
out of a certain little smarty pants, 
tonight. (CHUCKLE) 
A WOMAN approaches. 
WOMAN

you to stop wasting your money in this 
stupid place.

Marge pulls up to the school to drop Lisa off for band 
practice. 
MARGE 
Now Lisa, listen to me. This is 
important. I want you to smile today. 
LISA 
But I don't feel like smiling. 
MARGE 
Well, it doesn't matter how you feel 
inside, you know. It's what shows up 
on the surface that counts. That's 
what my mother taught me. Take all 
your bad feelings and push them down, 
all the way down, past your knees, 
until you're almost walking on them. 
And then you'll fit in, and you'll be 
invited to parties, and boys will like 
you... and happiness will follow. 
Lisa attempts a small smile. 
MARGE (CONT'D) 
Come on. You can do better than that. 


Marge smiles broadly to demonstrate. Lisa smiles more 
broadly.

Homer removes the toothbrush and guzzles down a beer. A

HOMER 


MARGE 
Do you ever drink to escape from reality?

His head twitches involuntarily as he goes to get the

CHUCK 
But it's got my name on it. 
CHUCK'S DAD

Homer stands before RALPH with an exhibit entitled "Alcohol 
Fueled Car." A little race car goes around in circles on a 
track. 
HOMER 
(INTRIGUED) Alcohol fueled, huh? 


Homer picks up a small bottle. He unscrews the eye dropper 
and moves it toward his mouth. 


RALPH 
It's not that kind of alcohol, sir. It 
could make you blind. 

HOMER 
Totally blind or could I still see shapes 
and stuff?

APPLAUSE erupts on the other side of the room. Lisa pushes 
through the crowd to discover Bart's booth. He stands in a 
straw boater, BARKING people to his exhibit. 
BART 
Step right up folks! We'll answer the 
question that has been plaguing scientists 
for ages. Can hamsters fly planes? 


The hamster is seated in a "Spirit of St. Louis" model 
airplane. The parents are charmed. 


PARENT ONE 
Oooh, look he's got miniature goggles on! 
PARENT TWO 
And a little scarf, isn't that adorable?

and half uncola. 


MOE 
That'll be seven dollars. 
HOMER 
Hey Moe, you never drink. Did you ever 
notice that Billy's not that funny? 
MOE 
(DANGEROUSLY) (SIGHS) What do you mean, 
Homer? 
HOMER 
I don't know. Everyone cones here to

ANNOUNCER on a fan's radio. 
BASEBALL ANNOUNCER (V.0) 
The windup and the two two pitch... Oh no! 
The batter is calling for time... Looks 
like he's going and getting himself a new

SELMA 
Uh huh. This is the 128 ounce tub. You 
can fit your whole head in it. 
Selma shoves her head into the translucent bowl. Her face 
becomes hideous and distorted; her lips are crushed and 
distended. You can see the stains from the breath of her 
nostrils. She leans over to her IGUANA -- he PUFFS himself up 
in fear.

MILHOUSE (У.0.) 
Hey, didn't he used to be the Mad 


Russian? 


BART is sitting in his living room with LEWIS, MILHOUSE and 
RICHARD. They are all sipping soda, munching crunchy snack 
food and watching wrestling on television. LISA sits ina 
chair off to the side, reading a math book. 


On the television, Rasputin begins waving Soviet and 
American flags.

LISA 
Yes, but I'm afraid that the forces of 
history have changed wrestling, perhaps 
forever. 
TV ANNOUNCER (У.0.) 
(FROM TV) And the challenger, from the 
University of Transylvania, Professor 
Krumnow. 
KRUMNOW is a huge, mad scientist-type wearing a mortarboard 
апа lab coat, which he tears off and discards as he enters. 
The kids all CHEER except for Bart. 
BART 
So brilliant, so evil. 
RICHARD 
But didn't he save Hillbilly Fats with 
an operation he performed in the ring? 
BART 
Yes, yes. But just two weeks later, in 
a cage match -- 
INT. MOE'S TAVERN - DAY 


HOMER, BARNEY, MOE and ASSORTED BARFLIES are watching the 
match. 


HOMER 
(TO BARNEY) -- Professor Krumnow 
hypnotized Trog the Cave Man and forced 
him to not only pin himself, but to 


shave his own head. 


TABLE DRAFT 5/4/90 PAGE 3. 


MOE 
What drives a man to such villainy? 
(YELLING) Boo. 

BARNEY 
(TO THE TV) Boo, you dirty no-good 
bum. (BURPS) 


On the television, Rasputin is twirling Professor Krumnow 
over his head. 


TV ANNOUNCER (У.0.) 
(FROM TV) Things do not look good for 
the Professor. Oh! And Rasputin has 
launched him like Sputnik! 


Rasputin tosses Krumnow out of the ring and into a group of 
SPECTATORS. 


BART 
Now, those are great seats. Hey, 
Milhouse, turn it up. 


Milhouse gets up off the couch to ADJUST the sound, and 
quickly Bart steals his seat. 


MILHOUSE 
Hey, I was sitting there. 

BART 
Right. Now I'm sitting here. Pass the 
Salt Doodles. 


Milhouse hands Bart a box of weird twisty-shaped crackers 
covered entirely with salt. 


INT. MOE'S TAVERN - CONTINUOUS 


Homer, sitting at the bar, is arguing with a Barney. 


TABLE DRAFT 5/4/90 PAGE 4. 


BARNEY 
But I only got up to go to the can. 
HOMER 
Hey, I don't see your name engraved on 
this bar stool. 
BARNEY 
But my drink's right in front of you... 
Hey, what happened to my pickled egg? 
HOMER 
Don't look at пе. 


Homer gives Barney a guilty smile, which reveals bits of 
egg on his teeth. He BURPS. 


On the television, Rasputin has dragged Professor Krumnow 
back into the ring. As Rasputin punches him, the audience 
is COUNTING along with each smash in the face. Rasputin 
also stamps on the ground to the beat of the punches to 
further accent the violence.

While Rasputin's back is turned, Professor Krumnow stumbles 
to his feet and pulls a large wrench from his trunks. 
Krumnow sneaks up behind Rasputin and smacks him over the 
head with the wrench. Rasputin falls to the ground, 
unconscious. 
TV ANNOUNCER (У.О. CONT'D) 

(FROM TV) ОП, my. Why is the referee 

permitting this? 
Krumnow casually pins Rasputin's shoulders to the mat ала. 
is declared champ. The audience in the Super Dome BOOS and 
throws cups in the ring.

EXT. SPRINGFIELD - MOMENTS LATER 

The Simpson car driving down the road approaches camera. 
Homer, behind the wheel, races through Springfield with 
great determination. The car drives away from the camera 
and down the road. 

EXT. SIMPSON HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER 


Homer pulls into the driveway very fast and comes to a 
SCREECHING halt. 


INT. SIMPSON LIVING ROOM - AT THAT MOMENT 
Bart hears the sound of Homer's car in the driveway. 
EXT. SIMPSON HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 
Homer hurries out of his car. Bart runs out of the house 
and down the front path. Homer and Bart meet in the center 
of the path, finally face to face. They look into each 
others' eyes for a moment then blurt out the news. 
BART & HOMER 
TRUCKASAUROUS ! 
They hug. 
BART 
Jinx. You owe me a Coke, man. 
HOMER

Homer, Bart, Lisa, MAGGIE and MARGE sit around the Simpson 
dinner table, chewing loudly and scarfing down their meal. 


SNOWBALL II and SANTA'S LITTLE HELPER gobble food out of 
their respective dishes. Everyone's food looks the same.

` HOMER 

I have an announcement to make. Asa | 
family growth thing, Bart and I think 
we should all go to the Monster Truck 
Rally this Saturday. 

BART 
Yeah! ! 

LISA | 


Aren't you forgetting something? 


HOMER 
Uh... (TO HIMSELF) Monster Truck 
Rally, growth thing... (TO LISA) No, 


I don't think so. 
MARGE 
Homer, Lisa's recital is Saturday 
night. 
LISA 
I'll be playing my first solo. If you 
miss it on Saturday, I'd advise you to 
start looking for child therapists on 
Sunday. 
BART 
But Truckasaurous is one night only! 
HOMER 
(DISTRAUGHT) Oh, cruel fate. Why do 
you mock me? А 


Homer and Bart begin to WEEP openly. 


TABLE DRAFT 5/4/90 PAGE 10. 


MARGE 
Now, come on, you two. Lisa's recital 
starts at five o'clock and the truck 
rally starts at eight. We can go to 
both. 
HOMER 
But what about the tail gate party and 
watching them fuel the tractors? 
MARGE LISA 
(ANGRY) Homer. (ANGRY) Dad. 
HOMER 
I only brought them up as examples of 
the things I'm happy to miss for my 
daughter. 
INT. AUDITORIUM - EVENING 
The auditorium is crowded with PARENTS AND RELATIVES of the 
children in the orchestra. The Simpsons are seated and 
happily anticipating the evening. Lisa sits with her 
saxophone in the second chair of the orchestra. NED 
FLANDERS and his son ROD are seated close to the Simpsons. 
MR. LARGO stands in front of the orchestra, and PRINCIPAL 
SKINNER stands at a microphone on stage trying to quiet the 
crowd. 
SKINNER 
(STERNLY) People, quiet down, now. 
Don't make me flick the lights on and 
off. (THEN) Ladies, gentlemen, 
parents and music lovers. Welcome to 


the first in a series of Saturday 


evening concerts. 


TABLE DRAFT 5/4/90 PAGE 11. 


HOMER 
Series?! (МОАК5) 
SKINNER 
Tonight Sherbert's... uh, Schubert's 
Unfinished Symphony. 
HOMER 
Oh, good, unfinished. This shouldn't 
take long. 
Largo strikes up the band. Lisa and the orchestra PLAY a 


shaky version of "The Unfinished Symphony" as the Simpsons 
happily watch on. 


DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. AUDITORIUM - LATER 


Lisa plays a lovely but short S0LO. Homer stands апа

Sit down, Homer.

The piece ends and Largo brings the orchestra to a stop. 
The audience APPLAUDS. Homer looks at his watch. It's 


6:30. 
HOMER 
How much longer was this Sherbert 
planning on making this piece of junk? 


Flanders leans in to Homer. 


TABLE DRAFT 5/4/90 PAGE 12. 


FLANDERS 
My, Lisa was wonderful. She certainly 
has come a long way with her fingering. 
HOMER 
Thanks, Flanders. (SOTTO TO MARGE) 
Big know-it-all. 
ROD 
When is Todd's solo, Dad? 
FLANDERS 
Shhh. It's coming up, son, it's coming 
up. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. AUDITORIUM - LATER 
Homer looks at his watch. It's 7:23. Todd Flanders plays 
a particularly beautiful VIOLIN 5010. Homer sees that 
Flanders is crying. 
HOMER 
(SYMPATHETIC) Hey, come on, Flanders, 
turn off the faucets. Your kid isn't 
that bad. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. AUDITORIUM - LATER 


Homer looks at his watch. It's 8:05. The Simpsons writhe 
uncontrollably. 


SKINNER 
And now, Chopin's Minute Waltz. 
HOMER 


Great, how long is this gonna take? 


а а en ee eee + 


TABLE DRAFT 5/4/90 


The orchestra PLAYS. We INTERCUT Homer, his watch, Marge, 
Lisa and Bart, building tension as the waltz plays out. 


HOMER (CONT'D) 
(TO LARGO) Tempo! Tempo! 


Largo gives Homer a look. After about a minute, the piece 
ends. Everyone is out of breath. The audience APPLAUDS. 


HOMER 
Finally, some honesty. 


As Largo and the STUDENTS take a bow, Homer runs up on 
stage and whisks Lisa away before she can finish her bows. 


INT. SIMPSON CAR - NIGHT 
Homer is driving like a mad man through the streets of 
Springfield. He is passing cars on the shoulder, nearly 
hitting other cars, and being HONKED at all the while. 
LISA 
Faster, Dad. 
BART 
Truckasaurous awaits. 
MARGE 
Homer, be a defensive driver. 
HOMER 
Sometimes the best defense is a good 
offense. 
EXT. SPRINGFIELD SPEEDWAY - NIGHT 
Homer finally pulls into the parking lot of the Springfield 
Speedway. The marquee reads, "Tonight: Monster Truck Rally 
featuring Truckasaurous and Special Guest." And in smaller 
letters below: "Sunday Night: Bear Baiting". 
The dirt parking lot is filled to capacity with cars, 
trucks and vans which all have white trash bumper stickers 
on them: "Don't come a-knockin' if this van's a-rockin'"; 
and "Don't laugh, your daughter's in here" are a few 


examples. Homer can't find a parking space anywhere and is 
getting mud all over his car from the dirt.

MARGE 
There's a space. Next aisle over. 
Homer makes a bee-line to the spot, but is cut off by a 
tough looking GUY in a truck. As the truck swerves, it 
covers Homer's windshield with mud. Homer drives on. 
Homer sees what appears to be open section in the speedway 
fence where he thinks he can find more parking. He drives 
through what looks like a service alley until he spins out 
in a pool of mud, which also coats the windshield. The car 
is stuck. The wheels of the car just spin as Homer tries 
to get the car moving. 
HOMER ] 
Damn unpaved backwoods general parking. 


Lisa looks out the back window to see imposing metal FEET 
coming toward then. 


LISA 
Dad? 

HOMER 
Not now, Lisa. 


Homer MUTTERS to himself as he tries to put the car into a 
gear that will run. 


MARGE 
(WEAKLY) Homer. 
HOMER 
What? 
A GIANT SHADOW engulfs the car. 
BART 
Truckasaurous! 
HOMER 
(EXCITED) Where, where? (LOOKS UP; 


SHRIEKS) 


TABLE DRAFT 5/4/90 PAGE 15. 


EXT. SPEEDWAY - CONTINUOUS 


We see that the Simpsons' car is being stalked by 
TRUCKASAUROUS. Homer gets the car to move about two feet, 
but then it gets caught in more mud. The crowd goes WILD 
as Truckasaurous moves closer and engulfs the frightened 
family in flames. Finally, the mammoth metal monster picks 
up the car in its gaping jaws and begins to crush the car, 
with the Simpsons in it. Above all the NOISE we hear the 
Simpsons SCREAM in terror. 


FADE OUT. 


TABLE DRAFT 5/4/90 PAGE 16. 


FADE IN: 
EXT. SPRINGFIELD SPEEDWAY - NIGHT 
An EMERGENCY CREW is using blow torches and the jaws of 
life to extract Homer from the chewed body of the car. 
Marge, Lisa, Maggie, and Bart are off to the side watching 
the action. JACK SCRAPER and his TEAM of insurance 
adjusters, are walking around the scene of the accident. 
He is wearing a yellow plastic pancho and yellow hard hat 
that reads "AllStar Insurance Disaster Team." He walks up 
to Marge. 
MARGE 
We really appreciate the insurance 
company sending you out here like so 
quickly. 
SCRAPER 
That's what we're here for, Mrs. 
Simpson. 
He ‘looks down at his clip board. 
SCRAPER (CONT'D) 
Let's see, cracked windshield, melted 
bumpers, punctured radiator, teeth 
marks in the trunk and crushed 
transmission. Оп the plus side, there 
doesn't seem to be any frame damage. 
How did this thing happen? 
HOMER 
(FROM INSIDE CAR) It wasn't my fault 


Truckasaurus jumped right out in front 


of me. 


TABLE DRAFT 5/4/90 PAGE 17. 


SCRAPER 
Uh huh. Well, this check should take 
care off everything. 
Scraper writes out a check and hands it Marge. 
MARGE 
Thank you so much. 
He and his team walk away in formation. 
BART 
Mom, do we have to stay here and watch 
Dad get rescued? Can't we at least see 
the mud pull? 
MARGE 
Just hold your horses, Bart. 
At the car, rescue workers still try to free Homer. There 
is a large hole cut in the roof of the car and they try to 
pull Homer through the hole but he is too fat. 
RESCUE WORKER 
Mr. Simpson for the last time tell us 
your waist size. 
HOMER 
(FROM INSIDE THE CAR) I'm a size 
thirty-six. 
RESCUE WORKER 
Mr. Simpson if you were a thirty-six 
you'd of been out of here a long time 
ago. 


Marge goes over to one of the rescue workers. 


TABLE DRAFT 5/4/90 PAGE 18. 


MARGE 
(WHISPERING) He's a forty-four, but 
don't tell him I told you. 

RESCUE WORKER 
I understand. 


The rescue worker tells the others who immediately cut a 
new hole in the roof. 


DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. SPEEDWAY STANDS - LATER 
Bart, Marge, Lisa, and Maggie sit in the stands watching 
the last heat of a mud pull. On-lookers AD LIB: "Wow, did 
ya see how far she dragged that cement block through the 
mud." "The Kid's a real talent." " Fine showing." "I 
haven't seen anything like it since MUD FOOT in '85" 
MARGE 
Wow, a woman mud pull driver. 
LISA 
Another barrier broken. (Yelling) 
Right-on, sister. 
Homer appears at the top of the stands carrying lots of hot 
dogs, popcorn, nacho chips and a monster-beer (the size of 
a small trash can) іп a souvenir "I survived Тгискаѕацгоцѕ" 
mug. 
HOMER 
Let the destruction begin. 
Homer examines his food. 
HOMER 
(DISAPPOINTED) Hey, they forgot my 


churo.

Homer has finished all the food in front of him, and he is 
picking his teeth with a ticket stub. 


TRACK ANNOUNCER 

For our last event of the evening we 

have a special surprise guest. The 

world's greatest Daredevil. The man who 

laughs at danger. The man who tells 

caution to take a hike: Captain Lance 

Murdock. 
The lights dim and haunting bull fighter MUSIC blares over 
the PA system. A spotlight hits an empty part of the 
speedway. There is a massive EXPLOSION revealing CAPTAIN 
MURDOCK. He runs out from the flames into the open field 


as the lights come up and people CHEER. It is clear that 
he is on fire. 


CLOSE UP - BART 
Bart is captivated by the event. Still on fire, Murdock 
grabs a mic and begins to speak as several SPEEDWAY 
WORKERS, with foam shooting fire extinguishers, put the 
fire out. 
MURDOCK 

Ladies, and gentlemen, and especially 

little children, I'm glad you are all 

here to witness what may very well be 

my grisly death. I'm sure you remember 

when I shattered my pelvis attempting 


to leap over the Trevi Fountain in ; 


Копе. 


TABLE DRAFT 5/4/90 PAGE 20. 


The crowd APPLAUDS appreciatively. 
MURDOCK (CONT'D) 
Others may remember my ill-fated 
attempt to launch myself into orbit and 
the six years I spent learning how to 
walk again. 
More APPLAUSE. 
MURDOCK (CONT'D) 
But tonight, my most dangerous stunt. 
I will defy both nature and gravity by 
leaping over this tank of water... 
A large steel water tank is revealed. 
MURDOCK (CONT'D) 

.. filled with man eating great white 
sharks, deadly electric eels, starving 
piranhas, bone crushing alligators, and 
perhaps most frightening of all, the 
king of the jungle, one ferocious lion. 


A large lion cage is lowered opened and tilted so that a 
LION falls into the tank. The crowd ООООНБ. 


MURDOCK (CONT'D) 
And, just to make things interesting, I 
will add to this dangerous brew, one 
drop of human blood. 
Murdock walks up to the tank, pricks his finger with a 
needle and squeezes a drop of blood in the tank. The 


SOUNDS of snapping jaws, electric current being discharged, 
bubbling water, and an occasional ROAR is heard. 


0o — - 66—02... 


TABLE DRAFT 5/4/90 PAGE 21. 


MURDOCK (CONT'D) 
On the chance that I don't survive, let 
me just say, buckle-up. 


The Captain jumps on his tricked out motorcycle and SCREAMS 
off doing a wheelie. From an angle just above the water 
line inside the tank, we see shark fins circling, an eel 
slither by, and the lion ominously swims by with only it's 
eyes and nostrils above the water line. 


BART ' 


This is so cool. 
The Captain rides back once, doing a wheelie and inspecting 
the ramp. There is an OMINOUS DRUM ROLL. The crowd is 
hushed. The motorcycle REVS and Murdock takes off toward 
the ramp. 


HOMER 
I can't watch. 


Homer covers his eyes. The camera PULLS BACK to see Marge 
and Lisa put their hands over their eyes. Marge takes one 
hand and puts it over Maggie's eyes. 


PULL BACK again to see the entire crowd has their eyes 
covered. Bart is the only one with his eyes open, and he is 
in heaven. Just as Murdock's cycle hits the ramp, it flips 
over. Murdock is flung at high speed up the ramp with the 
force of the crash. He tries to slow his fall by flinging 
his arms out and grabbing something, but he continues to 
roll end over end toward the tank of doom. Тһе audience 
GASPS as he falls into the tank where he is savagely 
attacked, bitten and shocked by the animals. Through the 
furiously bubbling water one can only see the flurry of 
activity and occasional electric flashes. Murdock 
valiantly fights his way toward the side of the tank and 
just about pulls himself out when, from out of nowhere, the 
lion violently grabs Murdock and drags him back in the 
tank. The Simpsons watch on in horror, all except Bart who 
sees the beauty in the stunt. 


BART 


Bitchin'! 


TABLE DRAFT 5/4/90 PAGE 22. 


We see Murdock being dragged out of the tank by RESCUE 
WORKERS. Murdock is badly hurt, bitten, and bloody. He 
still attempts to swagger as the rescue team straps him 
into the gurney. Murdock gives the crowd a very shaky 
thumbs up just before he blacks out. 
TRACK ANNOUNCER 
He's okay, folks. 
The crowd CHEERS.

That concludes the entertainment 


portion of the evening. 


The bright white flood lights are turned on throughout the 
stadium, signaling the end of the evening. 


INT. SIMPSONS CAR - NIGHT 
Homer and the family are somehow driving slowly home in the 
badly damaged car. Marge's hair sticks out of the hole in 
the roof, blowing violently in the wind. Cars HONK and 
pass The Simpsons as they fondly remember their evening. 
MARGE 
What a fun-filled evening. What was 
everybody's favorite part? 
HOMER 
That's easy, the nachos. 
LISA 


What was your favorite part, Bart? 


Bart doesn't answer because he's lost in a daydream. The 
camera enters Bart's eye and we see: 


TABLE DRAFT 5/4/90 PAGE 23. 


Bart imagines himself, sightly better built, wearing the 
exact same outfit as Captain Murdock, and riding around on 
a skateboard. Bart gives a thumbs up at the end of the 
ramp and, as the crowd ROARS, races up toward the tank. 
Bart flies up through the air and drops directly into the 
tank, where he is bitten ferociously and pulled from the 
tank by rescue workers. Bart, mauled and bleeding, is put 
on a stretcher. Bart gathers his strength to wave to the 
crowd. The crowd CHEERS and gets on their feet CHANTING 
"Bart, Bart, Bart...." The crowd noise fades in the 
distance as Marge's voice is heard more clearly saying: 
LISA (0.S.) (CONT'D) 
Bart, Bart, Bart... 


As the camera slowly leaves Bart's eye, there is a new 
expression of determination on Bart's face. 


LISA (CONT'D) 
Bart, what was your favorite part? 
BART 
When I found what I was put on this 
Earth for. 
HOMER 
Yeah, those were some nachos. 
LONG SHOT 
The nearly destroyed car slowly rolls down the street. 
EXT. SIMPSON HOUSE - DAY 
Bart is setting up a ramp as Lewis, Milhouse and Richard, 
stand around in the Simpson driveway. Bart drags the ramp 
over so that it is just above the grill of Marge's car. He 
is obviously preparing to jump the car length-wise. 
MILHOUSE 
You're crazy, Bart. 


RICHARD 


You're never gonna make it. 


TABLE DRAFT 5/4/90 PAGE 24. 


BART 
Spare me your lectures, ladies. 
Bart puts on a football helmet, steps on his skateboard and 
takes off. He heads toward the ramp with as much speed as 
he can muster. Bart hits the ramp and the skateboard 
wobbles off in one direction, Bart flying off the in the 
other. His head bounces off the windshield. 
BART (CONT'D) 
Oof! 
He winds up in a heap on the driveway. 
LEWIS 
Oh no! He's hurt! 
RICHARD 
Bad! 
MILHOUSE 
Let's get out of here! 
They scatter. 
EXT. SPRINGFIELD HOSPITAL - DAY 
The large white building with a large sign saying 
“Springfield General Hospital" There is a smaller sign 
underneath it reading, "Cash Only." 
INT. EMERGENCY WAITING AREA - DAY 
A worried Marge sits with Lisa in the sparsely furnished 
waiting area along with other people, some of whom are 
waiting for medical attention. All eyes turn as DOCTOR 
JULIUS HIBBERT, a black man, every bit a professional, 
enters the room with Bart. Bart has a small bandage where 
he hurt himself. Marge runs up to Bart and hugs him. 
MARGE 
Oh, my little boy, are you all right? 
BART 
Better than all right, I got stitches. 


Bart lifts his patch up so Lisa can peek inside. 


TABLE DRAFT 5/4/90 PAGE 25. 


LISA 
Ewwww. 
BART 
(PROUDLY) Probably have a scar too. 
HIBBERT 
Mrs. Simpson, Bart tells me he injured 
himself training for a career in death 
defiance. 
MARGE 
Yes, well, we saw a daredevil last 
night and well, you know, monkey see, 
monkey do. 
HIBBERT 
Hmmm. I think I know something that 
might discourage him from this sort of 
behavior. 
INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY 
Doctor Hibbert walks with Bart as Marge and Lisa follow. 
HIBBERT 
Bart, in this ward are the children who 
have been hurt by imitating stunts they 
Saw on television, movies and the 
legitmate stage. 


She stops in front of two opaque doors. She swings open the 
doors. 


INT. HOSPITAL WARD - DAY 


The room is filled with KIDS in various stages of 111 i 
health. Each bed features a child with a different injury. 


TABLE DRAFT 5/4/90 PAGE 26. 


НІВВЕКТ 
This little boy broke both his legs 
when he tried to fly like Superman. 

They walk to the next bed. 

HIBBERT (CONT'D) 
This young girl suffered two scratched 
corneas when her brother poked her in 
the eyes after watching the Three 
Stooges. 


They walk on passing a BOY with his head wrapped in 
bandages. 


HIBBERT (CONT'D) 
And this is her brother who, in the 
same regrettable incident, was hit in 
the head with a shovel. 

MARGE 
Gee, I never realized TV was such a 
dangerous influence. 

DR. HIBBERT 

(TO MARGE) Well, actually, it's a two- 
edged sword. Watching years of Marcus 
Welby M.D inspired me to become a 
doctor. (TO BART) Bart, I hope I made 
my point. 

BART 
You certainly did, Doctor. 


They all exit. Bart sticks his head back in the door. 


TABLE DRAFT 5/4/90 PAGE 27. 


BART 
(TO KIDS) So long, dudes. Save me a 
bed. 
EXT. SPRINGFIELD STREET - DAY 


A Springfield Unified School District bus rolls down the 
highway filled with raucous KIDS. 


INT. BUS - DAY 
4 
Kids throw wads of paper, SCREAM, CRY, and generally FROLIC 
as the bus driven by OTTO rolls down the highway. MRS. 
KRABAPPEL sits in the front seat thumbing through a 
magazine. Bart stares out the window, concentrating on the 
view. Milhouse, sitting in the next seat, watches Bart. 
MILHOUSE 
Bart, I hope you learned your lesson. 
BART 
Milhouse, the greatest thrill of my 
life was banging off that windshield. 
I'm searching for my next big stunt. 
It's out there somewhere. I can feel 
it in my bones. 
ZOOM IN on Bart. We are in Bart's world and can no longer 
hear the kids in the background. Bart stares out the 
window as the bus passes twenty cars tightly packed 
together. 
BART (У.О.) (CON'T) 
Those cars give me an idea, but it's 
been done. 
The bus then passes a gully. 
BART (V.0.) (CONT'D) 


Gully? Naw, too survivable. 


The bus passes a waterfall. 


TABLE DRAFT 5/4/90 PAGE 28. 


BART (У.О.) (CONT'D) 
Too old fashioned. 
The SOUND of the bus squeaking to a stop bleeds into Bart's 
revery. Bart can hear what is going on as he files out of 
the bus behind all the other kids. 
EXT. SPRINGFIELD GORGE - CONTINUOUS 
Bart steps off the bus, and there standing in front of a 
giant picturesque gorge is RANGER SMYTHE, a very burly and 
outdoorsy female forest ranger, who sweeps her arm 
indicating the natural wonder. The gorge is deep, wide, 
and rocky with a raging river that runs through the center. 
SMYTHE 
Hello children, and welcome to 
Springfield Gorge. 
CLOSE UP - BART 


His eyes are wide with excitement as he walks closer to the 
edge. Bart has found the sight of his next stunt. 


BART 
Destiny, at last we meet. 


We hear an ECHO of Bart's words, "we meet, we meet, we 
meet." 


FADE OUT.

FADE IN: 
EXT. SPRINGFIELD GORGE - DAY 
Ranger Smythe shows Mrs. Krabappel's fourth grade class 
around Springfield Gorge. Bart is excitedly looking for 
the perfect spot to jump the gorge. Otto walks with Bart. 
SMYTHE l 
Teddy Roosevelt once called Springfield 
Gorge the third most breathtaking gorge 
in this part of the state. 
Otto and Bart, taking in the gorge, lag behind the group. 
OTTO 
(IMPRESSED) Man, this thing's pretty 
gnarly. I bet you could throw a dead 
body in there and no one'd ever find 
it. 
Ranger Smythe continues her lecture to the kids. 
SMYTHE 
...And when trail-blazing Jebediah 
Springfield came upon this glorious 
chasm, legend has it he spoke his 
famous words, "We'll never make it 
across that thing." And, thus, the 
town of Springfield was born. 


Bart raises his hand. 


TABLE DRAFT 5/4/90 PAGE 30. 


BART 
Excuse me, ma'am, how wide is this 
gorge? 
SMYTHE 
Sixty-three feet. 
BART 
How much is that in busses? 
SMITH 
Seven. 
MRS. KRABAPPEL 
Well, Bart Simpson, it's a pleasure to 
see you finally take an interest in 
academics. 
BART 
Thank you, ma'am. 
SMYTHE 
Now, if you'll follow me, I'll show you 
the historic sight of Springfield's 
first snack bar and souvenir shop. 
The Ranger leads the class away. Bart stays back with Otto 
as he watches his classmates file past a natural rock 
formation that resembles a large ramp. Bart stares at it 
and comes to a realization. 
BART 
Otto, I'm gonna leap over Springfield 
Gorge on my skateboard. 
OTTO 
You know, Bart, as the only adult here 


I feel I should say something. 


TABLE DRAFT 5/4/90 PAGE 31. 


BART 
What? 
OTTO 
Cool. 
INT. SIMPSON KITCHEN - DAY 
Marge is HUMMING as she prepares dinner. Lisa enters and 
crosses to the refrigerator, which is covered with her 
grade "A" exams. 
LISA 
Hey, Mom, who took all the stars off of 
my exam papers? 
MARGE 
I don't know. Sometimes your brother 
takes things that don't belong to hin. 
INT. BART'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Bart is posing in front of a mirror. Spelled out in 
shining stars on his t-shirt is "Born 2 Leap". He also 
wears Homer's underwear as a cape. Lisa enters. 
LISA 
Bart, what are you doing? 
He turns to her. 
BART 
Puttin' on my work clothes, Lis. 
Pretty dazzling, huh? How do you think 
I'll look hurtling over Springfield 
Gorge in these? 
LISA 
Springfield Gorge? Bart, you could get 


killed. 


TABLE DRAFT 5/4/90 PAGE 32. 


BART 
Either way, it's a show. 
LISA 
Please, before you do anything, there's 
someone I'd like you to talk to. 
EXT. SPRINGFIELD HOSPITAL HALLWAY - DAY 


Lisa and Bart are standing with DR. HIBBERT in front of the 
door to a patient's roon. 


LISA А 
Thank you for arranging this, Dr. 
Hibbert. 
DR. HIBBERT 
Anything I can do to stem the tide of 
entertainment-related injury. 
Dr. Hibbert pulls open a hospital curtain revealing LANCE 
MURDOCK, who is completely immobile. His arms and legs are 
in traction and he sports a full body cast. Bart is 
unnerved. 
DR. HIBBERT (CONT'D) 
Lance, this is Lisa and Bart Simpson. 
Bart is one of your biggest fans. 
Lance puts on a brave face for Bart. 
BART 
It's an honor, Lance. How are you 
feeling? 
Lance HUFFS and PUFFS, sweats and strains, as he struggles 
to lift his thumb to the "thumbs-up" position. He finally 
accomplishes this task in obvious agony. A loud CRACK is 
heard. 


MURDOCK 


Doc. І heard а пар. 


TABLE DRAFT 5/4/90 PAGE 


Dr. Hibbert checks Murdock's thumb. 
DR. HIBBERT 
Hmm. I'm afraid the bone's broken. 
Well, that's all of then. 
Bart is stunned. 
MURDOCK 
Don't worry, partner. d'‘ve broken that 
thumb dozens of times. Hey, I bet 
you'd like an autograph. Nurse. 


A NURSE sticks a pen in Murdock's mouth and holds an eight 
by ten picture within reaching distance of the pen. 


MURDOCK (CONT'D) 
(WITH PEN IN MOUTH) Who should I make 
this out to? 
BART 
Master Bartholomew J. Simpson, Esquire. 
MURDOCK 
(WITH PEN IN MOUTH) Gimme a break, 
kid. 
BART 
Just Bart will be fine. 
Murdock begins to scrawl on the picture. 
MURDOCK 
(WITH PEN IN MOUTH) To Bart, good 
luck. Lance Murdock. 
Murdock finishes. The Nurse takes the pen out of Murdock's 


mouth and hands the picture to Bart. Bart takes the 
picture. It is completely unintelligible. 


33. 


TABLE DRAFT 5/4/90 PAGE 34. 


LISA 
Mr. Murdock, my brother is thinking 
about jumping Springfield Gorge on a 
skateboard. 
MURDOCK 
Good for hin. 
LISA 
No! Tell him not to do it! 
MURDOCK 
What? And deny the boy a chance to 
follow in my footsteps? (TO BART) 
Kid, you remind me of me when I was 
starting out. 
Lisa is shocked but Bart's spirits are lifted. 
LISA 
At least tell him to wait till he 
finishes school. 
MURDOCK 
(SCORNFUL) What? You're still іп 
school? What're you wasting your time 
there for? 
LISA 
Lance Murdock, you set a horrible 
example for the youth of America. 
MURDOCK 


Sticks and stones can break my bones. 


TABLE DRAFT 5/4/90 PAGE 35. 


LISA 


Bart Simpson, you're not jumping 


anything. 

BART 
Am too. 

LISA 
Am not. 

BART 
Am too. 

LISA 
Am not. 

BART 
Am too. 

LISA 


Am not. Because I'm telling Mom and 
Dad. 
INT. SIMPSON KITCHEN - MORNING 
The Simpsons are sitting around the kitchen table eating 
breakfast. Maggie smears oatmeal on her forehead with a 
spoon. 
HOMER 
Springfield Gorge? 
MARGE 
Out of the question. No son of mine is 
jumping over any gorge. 
BART 


(TO LISA) Squealer. 


TABLE DRAFT 5/4/90 PAGE 36. 


LISA 
I'm sorry, Bart. But if you got hurt or 
died, despite the extra attention I'd 
receive, I'd miss you. 

HOMER 
Bart, couldn't you just go around the 
gorge? Or wait till they build a 
bridge? 

BART 


Yeah, but that wouldn't be cool. 


HOMER 
You're right. 

MARGE 
Homer... 

HOMER 


Bart, we forbid you to jump over that 
gorge. 
BART 
You can't. 
HOMER 
We can and do. Go to your room, Bart! 


Bart gets up from the table. 


TABLE DRAFT 5/4/90 PAGE 37. 


BART 
Hey, man, you can tell me not to do it, 
but there's no way you can watch me 
twenty-four hours a day. And the 
minute your back is turned, I'm 
grabbing my skateboard and heading for 
the gorge. 
Bart storms off to his room. 
HOMER 
He's got us, Marge. There's nothing we 
can do. He's as good as dead. 
Homer puts his head in his hands and begins to SOB. 
LISA 
Dad, perhaps if you reasoned with hin, 
used your parental authority, he might 
be swayed. 
HOMER 
No. The kid's a goner. 
LISA 
(EXASPERATED) Dad! 
HOMER 
Well, if you think it'll help, 111 
try. 
INT. BART'S ROOM - LATER 


Homer sits on the bed next to Bart. He is demonstrating 
the folly of Bart's jump using a toy motorcycle. 


TABLE DRAFT 5/4/90 PAGE 38. 


HOMER 
Bart, say this motorcycle is you and 
the dresser is the other side of the 
gorge. I'm no scientist, but look 
what's going to happen. 
Homer revs up the toy motorcycle and lets it go. It sails 
off the bed and lands on the dresser, executing a perfect 
landing and coming to a smart 90 degree stop. 
HOMER (CONT'D) 
Okay, bad example. 
Marge appears in the doorway. 
HOMER (CONT'D) 
Listen, son, there are lots of things I 
like about being a father... (SITS А 
MOMENT, STUMPED) I think you get a tax 
deduction. But one of the many things 
I don't like is punishing you. If you 
just promise me you won't jump over 
that gorge, I'll be happy to let you 
out of this room and play in the yard. 
BART 
Okay, I promise. 


Bart starts to leave his room, but Marge stops hin. 


TABLE DRAFT 5/4/90 PAGE 39. 


MARGE 
Now, just wait a second. Son, do you 
know what a promise is? It's a sacred 
oath. I know it may seem cool to risk 
your life, but nothing is cooler than a 
young man who keeps his word to his 
parents. Do you understand what I'm 
saying? 
BART 
Yes, ma'am. 
HOMER 
So with that in mind, promise us that 
you won't try to jump over that gorge. 
BART 
(SOLEMNLY) I promise. 
HOMER 
That's my boy. 
Marge smiles. Homer and Marge exit. Bart starts to 
WHISTLE, grabs his costume and skateboard and heads out the 
window. 
EXT. SPRINGFIELD GORGE - DAY 
A large GROUP OF KIDS have turned out to see Bart jump over 
the gorge. Bart arrives wearing his "Born 2 Leap" uniform 
and carrying his skateboard. 
Bart eyes the ramp for a few moments, puts his skateboard 
in the ready position, and prepares to go. Just then he 
stops himself, and tests the wind with his finger. He 
gives the thumbs up and prepares to go when the Simpsons 
SCREECH up in their car. Homer runs out, followed by the 
whole family. 
HOMER 


Don't do it, boy! 


TABLE DRAFT 5/4/90 PAGE 40. 


BART 
I've got to, Dad. I know I can do it. 
HOMER 
But you promised. 
BART 
I had my fingers crossed. 
HOMER 
Damn. 
Homer slowly approaches Bart on the ramp. 
HOMER (CONT'D) 
Son, you can try it. I won't try and 
stop you, but if you jump, then I want 
to jump across this Springfield Gorge, 
too. 
BART 
But... 
Homer walks up the ramp. The rest of the family stands 
below, filled with fear. Homer takes the skateboard, and 
nervously puts his foot on it. 
HOMER 
(NERVOUS) No, Bart, I won't let you do 
it unless it's safe, so I'll go first. 
BART 
No, Dad, you'll never make it. It's 
too windy, and the rocks are slippery, 
and sixty-three feet is a lot farther 


than I thought it was. 


TABLE DRAFT 5/4/90 PAGE 41. 


HOMER 
Sounds like you're having second 
thoughts. 
BART 
Are you kidding? I'm terrified. The 
only thing that scares me more than 
certain death is all my friends calling - 
me chicken. 
HOMER 
Don't worry, son. I'll tell them I 
made you do it. 
BART 
Thanks, Dad. Let's get outta here. 
HOMER 
Oh, thank God. 
Homer still has one foot on the skateboard. His other foot 
lifts off the ground and he begins to suddenly travel at 
great speed down the ramp. Homer SCREAMS as he hits the 
lip of the gorge and is hurled into empty space. We see 
Homer's POV of the far gorge wall getting slightly closer 
and Homer's view of the long way down into the gorge. 
Homer continues to speed toward the other edge of the 
gorge. It looks as if he actually might make it. 
HOMER (CONT'D) 
(EXCITED) I'm going to make it! I'm 
going to make it! Bart was right, this 
is the greatest thrill of my life! I'm 
king of the world! 
Homer begins to descend and doesn't come close to making 
it, smashing into the far gorge wall. He tumbles down the 
rock face, smashing into little ledges along the way, until ! 


he lands at the bottom іп a pile of mud. Не tries to raise 
his head and is hit on the head by the falling skateboard. 


TABLE DRAFT 5/4/90 PAGE 42. 


An ambulance pulls up. Two MEN grab Homer and put him in 
the ambulance. The ambulance speeds away, drives ten feet 
and smashes into a tree. 
INT. SPRINGFIELD HOSPITAL - DAY. 
Homer is lying in traction. 
BART 
Sorry, Homer. 
HOMER 
Son, even though I'm in agony, it's 
worth it if you learned a lesson. 
Still want to jump the gorge? 
BART 
No way. I'd have to be an idiot to try 
something like that. 
PULL BACK to reveal Lance Murdock in the next bed. 
HOMER 
(TO LANCE) You think you've got guts, 
try raising my kids. 
FADE OUT.

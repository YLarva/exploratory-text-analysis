"SWEET SEYMOUR SKINNER'S BAADASSSSS SONG" 
by 


Bill Oakley & Josh Weinstein 


ACT ONE 
FADE IN: 
COLOR SUPER 8 FOOTAGE - CIRCA 1978 


We see 70's era Super-8 footage and hear SOULFUL JOE COCKER- 
STYLE MUSIC à la the opening of "The Wonder Years." 


1) Open on a scene of a young Homer and Marge clowning for 
the camera as they wash Homer's car. After a few seconds, 
the car slowly begins to roll out of the driveway and down 
the street. Homer frantically chases after it. SPLICE TO: 


2) Homer's birthday party, 1979. Homer now has a bushy 


beard and moustache. He opens and proudly displays his 
presents: a moustache cup, a 16-piece beard-grooming kit, 
and "Sebastian Cabot's Beard Book." Homer leans over to 


blow out the candles on his cake, and catches the bottom of 
his beard on fire. It spreads rapidly. 


BART (0.S.) 
(CHUCKLE) Oh, man. They are gonna eat 
this up at Show & Tell. 
PULL BACK TO REVEAL that we are... 


INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING 


Bart is projecting the movies onto the refrigerator door. 
Lisa looks on, and Marge prepares breakfast. 


MARGE 


I'm not sure I'm comfortable with the 


idea of your classmates laughing at our 


family's private moments. How would you 


like it if, 20 years from now, people 


were laughing at things you did? 
BART 


Not likely. 


The movie abruptly jumps to footage of an obviously drunk 
Marge wearing a sombrero and being put into a van marked 
"Policia de Tijuana." 

MARGE 


(ANNOYED MURMUR) Please, Bart. There 


must be something else you can take for 
Show & Tell. 
BART 


No way! This is the stuff of which B- 


minuses are made! Just because you may 


look a little foolish -- 


The film suddenly cuts to footage of a naked baby Bar 
sitting on his training potty and smiling earnestly at 
camera. 


Greet 


the 


BART (CONT'D) 


(EMBARRASSED GROAN) 


Out the window, we see the school bus drive up and HONK. 
BART (CONT'D) 
Argh! I gotta find something else 
quick! 
MARGE 
Why don't you bring this potato? It's 
pretty big. 


BART 


Mom, you're always trying to give me 

potatoes. What is it with you? 
MARGE 

I just think they're neat. 


The school bus HONKS again. 


INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - SOMEWHERE - A SECOND LATER 


Bart is rummaging through a closet. PULL BACK TO REVEAL it 
is Lisa's closet. Lisa runs in to get her book-bag and sees 
Bart. 

LISA 


Bart, get out of my closet! 

BART 
I gotta find something for Show & Tell. 
(BEAT) Where's that stupid clay cat you 


made at Lutheran day camp? 


LISA 
Just take one of my geodes. (OFF HIS 
LOOK) The rocks on my desk. (BEAT) 
No, that's the Trilobite... That's 
petrified wood... That's a bran muffin. 


INT. SCHOOL BUS - A MINUTE LATER 


Lisa and Bart, who is holding a geode, climb onto the bus. 
They turn to see that almost all the kids are holding 
geodes, many bigger and cooler than Bart's. The glare from 
the geodes is blinding. 


MARTIN 
Greetings, fellow geodologist. My geode 
was found in the Limpopo Basin of 


Mozambique. The natives call it "Olu 


Katunji" or "Rock which contains the 
Sun." Sit and tell me of your geode, 
Bart. 

BART 


(MOAN) I'll be right back. 


Bart runs out of the bus and looks desperately around for 
something to grab. His eyes light up as he sees Santa's 
Little Helper in the front yard, ripping the morning 
newspaper to shreds. 


INT. SCHOOL - BART'S CLASSROOM - LATER 


Nelson is in the middle of his Show & Tell. He is holding 
an empty can of tomato paste. 


NELSON 


The ingredients were (READING) "Fresh 


pureed tomatoes, water, salt, and Sodium 


Benzoate used to retard spoilage." Once 
again, if I'm not mistaken, this can 
contained tomato paste. 

MRS. KRABAPPEL 


Thank you, Nelson. Bart, you're next. 


Bart and the large, upside-down cardboard box next to him 
both stand up and walk to the front of the class. 


BART 
Boys and girls, Mrs. Krabappel, I come 
before you today to answer a question 
that has plagued mankind for centuries - 


- What has four legs and ticks? 


MILHOUSE 


(RAISING HAND) A walking clock? 


NELSON 
A walkin'-clock! 
MARTIN 
(ASIDE) I'd wager he has some variety 


of walking clock in that box. 


MRS. KRABAPPEL 
Bart, is it a walking clock? 
BART 
(CONFUSED) What? (BEAT) No, it's my 


dog! 


He lifts the box, revealing Santa's Little Helper, who wags 
his tail happily. The kids OOH and AAH. 


MRS. KRABAPPEL 
(DELIGHTED) Oh, he is a gem! Here, 
boy, would you like these cookies Martin 


made for me? 


She puts the box of cookies on the floor, and the dog wolfs 
them down. Martin looks on, disappointed. 


BART 


My dog's name is Santa's Little Helper. 


He likes to eat out of the garbage and 


drink out of the toilet. One time he 

crawled under the house, and when he 

came out he was covered with ants. 
CLASS 

Wow! 


SANTA'S LITTLE HELPER 


(PANTS, SMALL BARK) 


MILHOUSE 


Lookit! It's thirsty or happy or hot or 


somethin'! 
MRS. KRABAPPEL 


Thank you, Bart. Great job. 


The dog scratches itself. The enraptured class CHEERS AND 


APPLAUDS WILDLY. 


MILHOUSE 


(ASIDE, PROUD) I knew the dog before he 


came to class. 


Bart and the dog head back to their seats. 


their eyes glued to the dog. 


MARTIN 


Martin goes to 


the front of the class with his geode. All the kids keep 


(DRAMATIC) Ka-Boom!! That, the sound 


of the thunderous volcanic explosion 


which gives birth to the magnificent 


geode! One of nature's most marvelous - 


NELSON (0.S.) 


You're doin' it wrong. You gotta pet 


him hard so he can feel it. 


TURN TO REVEAL every kid near Bart is petting the dog. 
Nelson demonstrates his hard-petting technique, which makes 
the dog's face stretch into funny expressions. Santa's 


Little Helper PANTS HAPPILY then SNEEZES. 
SHERRI 
Looklooklook! The doggie sneezed! 


MRS. KRABAPPEL 


Ha! It thinks it's people! 


There is a TAPPING at the door. Groundskeeper Willie has 
his face pressed up against the little window and is 
excitedly trying to get the dog's attention. 


WILLIE 
(MUFFLED) Hey, pooch. Poochie-pooch. 
The dog glances over and Willie looks ecstatic. Everyone, 


including Mrs. Krabappel, is watching the dog, eagerly 
anticipating his next action. After a beat, he lies down. 


MILHOUSE 
It's lying down! 
WILLIE 


(MUFFLED) It thinks it's people! 


MRS. KRABAPPEL 
Ha! He sure does. You know, I had a 
dog once who... (OFF MARTIN'S LOOK, GLUM) 
All right, back to Show & Tell. We'll 
put the dog away. C'mon, boy. 

CLASS 


(GROANS ) 


Mrs. Krabappel leads the dog to a small coat room in the 
rear of the class. She puts the dog in, closes the door, 
and returns to her desk. Everyone, including Mrs. 
Krabappel, stares icily at Martin. 


MRS. KRABAPPEL 
Well, Martin, we're all waiting to hear 
about your geode. 

MARTIN 
This geode -- 


NELSON 


Shut up!! 
INT. SCHOOL - BART'S CLASSROOM - COAT ROOM - LATER 


Santa's Little Helper sits calmly on the floor. A smell 

wafts in from a nearby heating vent, and he goes over to 

SNIFF at it. We move into the vent and quickly follow it 
to: 


INT. SCHOOL - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS 


The fumes come from a huge steaming pot. lLunchlady Doris 
ladles meat into the pot from a big drum labeled "Assorted 
Horse Parts - Now With More Testicles!" 


LUNCHLADY DORIS 


(PROUD) More testicles mean more iron. 


INT. SCHOOL - BART'S CLASSROOM - COAT ROOM - SIMULTANEOUS 


The dog WHIMPERS and paws furiously at the vent. The 
grating swings open, and he walks tentatively into the vent. 
He scrabbles a bit and then we hear him walk off into the 
distance. 


INT. SCHOOL - BART'S CLASSROOM - A BIT LATER 
There are various CHUCKLES coming from the class. 
MRS. KRABAPPEL 
Well, I'm sure Ulysses Grant didn't 


think his own name was so funny. 


Anyway, in June 1863, he met with 
General Ambrose Burnside and General 
Joseph Hooker... 

CLASS 
(SNICKERS AND GUFFAWS) 

MRS. KRABAPPEL 
Class, please. Now, they were 


discussing the battle of McTitter's 


Mal Te. 
There is a duct running across the ceiling of the classroom. 
We hear the CLATTER of the dog's toenails as he runs through 
the duct. 


INT. SCHOOL - LISA'S CLASSROOM - A MINUTE LATER 


Santa's Little Helper peers through a grate above the class. 
RALPH 
Miss Hoover? There's a dog in the vent. 


MISS HOOVER 


(SKEPTICAL) Ralph, remember the tim 
you said Superman was outside? 


SANTA'S LITTLE HELPER 


(CHEERFUL BARK) 
The class sees the dog and becomes VERY EXCITED. 
LISA 
Oh, no. This could wind up being as 
embarrassing as Grandparent's Day. 
LISA'S THOUGHT BALLOON 


Grampa stands helplessly trapped in the middle of the jungle 
gym. Workmen use blowtorches to cut him out. 


INT. SCHOOL - PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - A MINUTE LATER 


An incredibly harried-looking Principal Skinner is on the 
phone. He has sweat stains under his arms and down his 
chest. All the lines on his phone are blinking. 
SKINNER 
(INTO PHONE) I know Weinstein's parents 


are upset, Superintendent, but I was 


sure it was a phony excuse. I mean, it 


10. 


sounds made up: "Yom Kip-pur?" (BEAT) 


Well, maybe there are problems here, but 


the drop in test scores is not my fault. 


What with the TV shows these kids watch, 


like that "Beavis and the Butthead"... 


What? I, I believe that's the name. 


Suddenly, a mob of very excited kids runs by, down the 
hallway. Willie sticks his head in the door. 


WILLIE 
(PANICKED) Sir, ye've goot to coom 
quick! There's a doog roonin' aroond in 
the air doocts! 

SKINNER 


I understand. (GRABS P.A. MICROPHONE) 


Children, this is Principal Skinner... 
INT. SCHOOL - BART'S CLASSROOM - THAT SECOND 
SKINNER (V.O. OVER P.A.) 
Remain calm. There is a dog in the 
vents. 
The class erupts in a frenzy. 


INT. SCHOOL - DUCT SYSTEM- LATER 


Santa's Little Helper hears all the YELLING and gets even 


more excited. He runs quickly down corridors of vents, 
BARKING. He slides down an inclined vent and spins around 
on all fours a la Bambi on the ice. He runs in another 


direction, then sits down right above a grate and begins to 
PANT FURIOUSLY. Drool runs down his tongue. 


INT. SCHOOL - FACULTY LOUNGE - CONTINUOUS 


The dog's drool drips out of the grate and into a cup of 


Tis 


coffee. 


HIPPIE TEACHER 


...-but it was a great concert -- pure 


Fogleberg. (PICKS UP COFFEE, SIPS. IT) 


The door flies open and Principal Skinner and Willie burst 
in, followed by a bunch of kids and teachers. 


SKINNER 
Ssshhh! (SOTTO, POINTING UP) He's up 


there. 


Principal Skinner gingerly climbs up on the table and 


unlatches the grate. From the dog's P.O.V., we see 
Skinner's head popping into the vent. He gives Skinner a 
big, wet lick across the face then calmly saunters off down 


the vent and around a corner. 
SKINNER (CONT'D) 


Uccch. (LOOKING DOWN) Excuse me! 


Pupils are not allowed in the Teacher's 


Lounge. 


Kids are now wandering around the lounge, picking up papers, 
looking in cabinets, etc. 


MILHOUSE 
Hey Bart, look, there's a bunch of 


drawings of you! 


He points to a bulletin board which says "Faculty Art 
Contest" and has several rude drawings of Bart drawn by 
various teachers. Skinner ushers the students out, except 
for Bart, who he restrains with an iron grip. 


SKINNER 
Bart Simpson, I understand this is your 
dog. Any suggestions? 


BART 


12. 


I could go into the vent and get him. 


SKINNER 


I can't take that responsibility. 


Willie, go into the vent and get him. 


WILLIE 
What?! Have ye gone waxy in the 
beester?! I canna fit in the wee vent, 


ye croquet-playin' mint-muncher! 
SKINNER 


Grease yourself down and go in, you... 


(THINKING) guff-speaking work-slacker. 
INT. SCHOOL - KITCHEN - A MINUTE LATER 


Willie comes running in. 
WILLIE 
Have ye got any grease? 
LUNCHLADY DORIS 


Yes. Yes we do. 
INT. SCHOOL - DUCT SYSTEM - A FEW MINUTES LATER 


A sweaty, greased-up Willie slithers through the cramped 
ducts, wearing only boxer shorts. Up ahead, there's a 
crossroad in the ducts. Something runs by very quickly, but 
Willie only catches a glimpse of it, à la "Alien." TENSE 
MUSIC BUILDS as we hear EERIE CREAKING from the ducts. 
Another shadow runs by. Willie looks frightened. 


INT. SCHOOL - PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - SIMULTANEOUS 


Principal Skinner watches a lighted board labelled "School 
Heating System." A BEEPING, blinking light shows Willie's 
location. Another BEEPING, blinking light is rapidly 
approaching him from behind. 


SKINNER 


abe oe 


Good lord! It's coming up right behind 
him! 
INT. SCHOOL - DUCT SYSTEM - SIMULTANEOUS 


Santa's Little Helper runs up behind Willie and begins 
licking his greased feet. Willie struggles but can't turn 
around. 


WILLIE 


(FRANTIC GIGGLES) 
INT. SCHOOL - HALLWAY - SIMULTANEOUS 


The duct runs along the hallway, which is packed with wild 
kids and teachers smoking and TALKING. They hear GIGGLING 
and BARKING coming from the duct. Kids start throwing 
books, baseballs, etc. at the duct. 


WILLIE (O.S.) 


(GIGGLING) Ouch! (GIGGLES) Ouch! 

MRS. KRABAPPEL 
Children, that's not helping. 

LISA 
Miss Hoover, maybe things would calm 
down if we went back to class and tried 
to keep working. 

MISS HOOVER 
Why don't you go in and erase the 
blackboard, and (LYING) the rest of us 
will join you in a bit. 


A very agitated Principal Skinner runs out of his office and 
into the mob. 


SKINNER 


(TRYING TO CORRAL KIDS) Baker, 


14. 


Atchison, Hymes! Return to your -- 
(SEES TEACHERS) Krabappel! Hoover! 
T'll see you in my vent this afternoon. 
MRS. KRABAPPEL 
Huh? 
SKINNER 
Don't you sass me! I am in no mood for 
back-chat, flip-lip, applesauce or flack 
of any kind! Capiche?! 


There is a SUDDEN CLATTER from the duct, and we hear Willie 
and the dog moving rapidly away. 


INT. SCHOOL - DUCT SYSTEM - THAT SECOND 


Willie is slithering after the dog as fast as he can go. 


INT. SCHOOL - NURSE'S OFFICE - A MINUTE LATER 


A watery-eyed Wendell, Martin, and Ralph sit on a cot, 
SNIFFLING AND SNEEZING. 


SCHOOL NURSE 
Boys, your hay fever was probably set 


off by the dog. Just rest here until 


the symptoms die down. 


There is a THUNDEROUS RUMBLING from the duct above them as 
the dog and Willie go by. A thick cloud of dust shoots out 
of the vent as the boys are showered with bits of plaster, 
bolts, etc. from overhead. They COUGH AND WHEEZE HORRIBLY, 
then simultaneously take out and use their inhalers. 


INT. SCHOOL - DUCT SYSTEM - A MINUTE LATER 


Willie closes in on Santa's Little Helper and grabs him. 
WILLIE 


Aha! There's nary an animal alive which 


Lys 


can outrun a greased Scotsman! Now, out 


we go. 


Willie POUNDS opens a grating, which falls from the duct. A 
few seconds later we hear it CLATTER to the ground in the 
distance. 


WIDE REVERSE ANGLE 


Willie and the dog peer out from the duct, which is 
suspended high above the empty gymnasium. The duct swings 
slowly and precariously back and forth. 


WILLIE 
Whoogh! "Tis more dizzying than the 
belfry at St. Corgegluynwaagen's! 
(PRODUCING A FLASK) Well, time for a 


nip of courage. 


The flask slips out of his greasy hand and CRASHES to the 
floor of the gym. 


WILLIE (CONT'D) 


Ach. 


SMASH CUT TO: 


INT. SCHOOL - GYMNASIUM - LATER 


The gym is filled with paramedics, police, firemen, 
teachers, and students. The firemen are raising a tall 
ladder under Willie and the dog. Chief Wiggum walks by 
Eddie and Lou, who are shooting baskets. 


CHIEF WIGGUM 


That's nice work, boys. 


Principal Skinner stands around blankly, looking like he's 
had a nervous breakdown. 


MRS. KRABAPPEL 


(LOOKING OUT WINDOW) (SING-SONG) Uh-oh. 


16. 


Someone's getting a visit from 


Superintendent Chalmers. 
SKINNER 
I-I... can't... take... this. 


MILHOUSE 


Uh, Principal Skinner, can I get you a 
glass of water or something? 
SKINNER 
Food and drink... not permitted... in 
gymnasium. 
Superintendent Chalmers storms in, livid. 
SKINNER (CONT'D) 
(PULLING HIMSELF TOGETHER) 
Superintendent Chalmers, you didn't have 
to come all the way down here. 


Everything's under control. 


In the background, the big ladder tips over, SMASHING a huge 
window and pulling down the scoreboard. 


SUPERINTENDENT CHALMERS 
I've had it with this school, Skinner: 
the low test scores, class after class 


of ugly, ugly children... 


SKINNER 


I hardly think the children's appearance 


should -- 


The firemen are now bringing Willie and the dog down. 
Greased-up Willie slides comically around the gym floor. 
Santa's Little Helper dashes happily over to Bart. 


Ers 


SUPERINTENDENT CHALMERS 


Isn't that the boy who hit me with a 


tractor last year? 
SKINNER 

(LYING) No, that boy was expelled. 
SUPERINTENDENT CHALMERS 


Tell me this: how did the boy smuggle a 


dog into school without your noticing? 
SKINNER 


Well, I did see him bringing in a large 


box this morning. But students bring 


big boxes in and out of this school 
everyday. I can't be expected to 


monitor the contents of every box. 


In the foreground, Jimbo walks by unnoticed with a big box 
of globes. 


SUPERINTENDENT CHALMERS 


(RUBBING HIS TEMPLES) And why was the 


custodian allowed to go in after the 
dog? 
SKINNER 


I sent him in. I didn't see any harm in 


sending a man into the heating system. 


Flames shoot out of the heating duct, catching part of the 
ceiling on fire. A PIERCING FIRE BELL RINGS, and a second 
later, the sprinkler system goes off. Torrents of water 
drench everyone in the gym. 


SUPERINTENDENT CHALMERS 


Seymour, I'm afraid you leave me no 


choice. You're fired. 


DRAMATIC MUSICAL STING 


I'm sorry, 


a liar? 


(PUZZLED) 


SKINNER 


(PEEVED) did you just call me 


SUPERINTENDENT CHALMERS 
No, I said you were fired. 


SKINNER 


Oh. That's much worse. 


FADE OUT:

ACT TWO 


INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING 


The family is eating breakfast. Bart looks glum. 


I thought I'd 
Skinner left, 
weird hot feel

That's guilt,

HOMER 


Whoa, whoa, whoa, let me get this 


straight. The 
school early, 


dog? 


Yeah, but --

20. 


HOMER 
Well, I'm off to work. 
Homer picks up the dog and dashes out the door. 
MARGE 
I think the dog has had enough 
excitement. 
HOMER 


(WHINY) But Marge, dogs can never get 


enough excitement. 


Homer spins around wildly while holding the dog. He and the 
dog look very happy. 


HOMER (CONT'D) 
(OFF MARGE'S LOOK) All right, all 
right, I won't take the dog. 


Homer walks over and starts to pick up Maggie. He thinks 
better of it, grabs the cat, and runs out. 


ESTABLISHING SHOT - NUCLEAR POWER PLANT 
INT. NUCLEAR POWER PLANT - HOMER'S WORKSTATION - LATER 


Standing at the door to his workstation, Homer eagerly 
gestures to Lenny and Carl. 


HOMER 


Psst, guys, I got a plan that'll get us 


out of work real early today. I give 


you ~= Plan "xX." 


Homer spins his chair around to reveal a frightened Snowball 
II sitting there. He tries to lift it up, but it digs its 
claws into the chair. He finally RIPS it free and sets it 
on the floor. 


HOMER (CONT'D)

Now, we sit back and wait for the 


fireworks. 


He sits down and swivels around, revealing the panic- 
stricken cat is frantically hanging onto the back of the 
chair with all fours. 


LENNY 
Can we go home yet? 
CARL 
Eh, I'll just go phone in a bomb threat. 


INT. SCHOOL - AUDITORIUM - DAY 


Superintendent Chalmers stands on stage. Sitting to his 
left is the sternest, meanest-looking man in the world. 


SUPERINTENDENT CHALMERS 
Because of Mr. Skinner's sudden 
departure, I've had to appoint a new 
principal. Leopold? 


The sternest, meanest man in the world (Leopold) approaches 
the podium. The children look horrified. 


STERNEST, MEANEST MAN 
All right, you little punks, prick up 
your freaking ears, because I'm only 
saying this once. From now on, things 


are going to be very different around 


here... with your new principal, Ned 


Flanders! 


The man APPLAUDS and sits back down as Ned strolls in from 
the wings. The audience APPLAUDS and SIGHS with relief. 


NED 


Tip-top o' the a.m. to every-good-body 


22. 


here! As chairman of the P.T.A., I'm 


honored to put on the Captain's hat and 


guide the good ship Springfield 


Elementary through the seas of academe. 
BART 
(SOTTO) Aye, aye, Captain Pushover. 


I'm lookin' forward to the freeee ride. 


NED 


Now I know everybody's eager to get back 


to class -- 

MRS. KRABAPPEL (0.S.) 
Ha! 

NED 


But I thought it might break the ice if 


we had a little Q&A. 
There is a LONG BEAT OF SILENCE. 
KEARNY 
(NUDGING JIMBO) Dude, ask a question or 
we'll have to go back to class. 


Jimbo stands up, looking very awkward. Everybody turns to 
look at him. 


JIMBO 
(NERVOUS) Um, do you, er, what's your, 
um, policy, on... um, lockers? 

NED 


I wouldn't want to go out on a limb, and 


stick my neck out before all the facts 


23% 


are in, but I'd say every student should 
have one. 
Superintendent Chalmers nods approvingly. Martin stands up. 
MARTIN 
We've all enjoyed your tenure as 
chairman of the PTA, particularly your 


monthly newsletter and "Neditorials," 


but tell us, who is slated to fill your 
shoes? 

NED 
(THINKING) Well, the by-laws stipulate 
the Sergeant-at-Arms would fill in for 
me, and I believe that would be... 

SMASH CUT TO:

HOMER 


(FURIOUS ANNOYED GRUNT) 


REVEAL that Homer is holding an official looking letter. 


HOMER (CONT'D) 


I do not recall volunteering to be 


Sergeant-at-Arms! 
FLASHBACK - PTA MEETING 
NED 
Who wants to be Sergeant-at-Arms? 


HOMER 


Me, me, me, me, me! Me, me, me, me! 


24. 


BACK TO REALITY 
MARGE 
Homer, all you have to do is lead a 
meeting once a month. 
HOMER 


But Marge, you know this family's not 


fit to hold high office. Grampa only 


served half his term in Congress before 


he was kicked out. 


Homer points to a framed newspaper with the headline 
"Watergate Axe Falls: Haldeman, Ehrlichman, Simpson 
Indicted." Below is a photo of Grampa, in a 70's style 
suit, being escorted down the Capitol steps by police. 


INT. QUIK-E-MART - DAY 


Bart and Milhouse are using the self-service soft ice cream 
machine. 


APU 
Young men! Your gargantuan cone is 
making a mockery of our self-serve 
policy! 


REVEAL that their cone is over a foot tall and growing. 
Milhouse turns and sees something. 


MILHOUSE 


Bart, look. It's Principal Skinner, and 


I think he's gone crazy. He's not 


wearing a suit or tie or anything! 


Principal Skinner comes out of a nearby aisle carrying a 
shopping basket. He is wearing jeans, Keds, and a sweater. 


BART 


Principal Skinner... Um, I'm real sorry 


about my dog getting you fired, and 


biting you, and then making that mess in 
your office. 
Skinner starts putting his groceries on the counter. 
SKINNER 


Well, maybe it was for the best. Now I 


finally have time to do what I've always 
wanted: write the Great American Novel. 
(PROUD) It's about a futuristic 


amusement park where dinosaurs are 


brought to life through advanced cloning 
technigues! 


Bart, Milhouse, and Apu look very uncomfortable. 


SKINNER (CONT'D) 


I call it "Billy and the Clone-o- 
saurus!" 

APU 
(CAN'T CONTROL HIMSELF) Oh god! First, 
you think of an idea that has already 
been done! And then, you give it a 


title that nobody could possibly like!!

MONTAGE of Flanders running the school. 


1) INT. SCHOOL - BART'S CLASSROOM - MORNING 


NED (OVER P.A.) 


Guten morgen, teachers and learners. 


This is Pr 


incipal Flanders. I'd like to 


wish a happy 10th birthday to Wendell 


Tompkins; a happy 8th to Wilma 


Wangshrink 


-- hmm, she seems to have a 


birthday every week; and a happy 44th to 


our own Edna Krabappel. 


Mrs. Krabappel grimaces, stares furiously at the 
loudspeaker, and starts erasing an elaborate drawing on the 


blackboard which says "Mrs. 


your class." 


2) INT. SCHOOL - PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - DAY 


Bart sits calmly in front of Ned. 


piece of candy from the bowl on Ned's desk. 


NED 


Bart, I'm beginnin' to get the feelin' 


you'd rather be in here than in class. 


This is fifth time you've been sent to 


my office 


this week, and now that I have 


peanut butter cups, you seem to be 


K -- Happy 36th Birthday from 


26. 


He periodically takes a 


2 Tis 


comin' every hour. 

BART 
(MOUTH FULL OF PEANUT BUTTER CUPS) 
Mufft be a co-in-fa-dince. (STALLING) 
Say, Ned, I saw you patching the cracks 


in your driveway this weekend. 


NED 
(TOO EXCITED) Oh, yeah. What happened 
was, the roots from the sycamore cracked 


some of the asphalt, but I just got in 


there with some Sakrete -- well, the 


thing about Sakrete is... (ETC.) 


With a devilish look, Bart leans back and begins eating more 
peanut butter cups. 


INT. SPRINGFIELD LAUNDROMAT - AFTERNOON 


Skinner stands thoughtfully in front of the detergent 
vending machine. 


SKINNER 
Let's see. Tide, Cheer, Bold, Biz, Fab, 


All, Gain, Wisk. I believe today I will 


CEY ees Bold. 


Bart skateboards past the front of the laundromat. Skinner 
excitedly beckons him in. 


SKINNER (CONT'D) 
Bart! What's the rush? Is there a new 
"comic-book" in town? 

BART 


I'unno. Sure, probably. 


28% 


SKINNER 
So tell me, how's school? 

BART 
It's a lot of fun. 

SKINNER 
Fun? That doesn't sound good. A school 
described as "fun" is not being run 
efficiently. (BEAT) Has there been any 
talk about me, or the possibility of my 
return? 

BART 


No. 


Skinner looks glum, and we see a guilty look in Bart's eye. 

BART (CONT'D) 

Well, it was good to see you. 
SKINNER 

(HAPPY) It was? Then we should get 

together again! Say Saturday, at my 

house. Do you know where I live? 
BART 

(LYING) Um, no. 


BART'S THOUGHT BALLOON 


A kid wearing a mask (obviously Bart) toilet papers the 
trees in front of Skinner's house as Skinner peers out the 
window, horrified. 
INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT 

HOMER 


Kids, as chairman of the P.T.A., I'd 


like to ask you a very serious question: 


has Principal Goobatron screwed up the 
Jerk Academy yet? 
BART 
Actually, I like Ned. He's made school 
a lot more fun for us troublemakers. 
HOMER 


Well, if it isn't the head of the 


Flanders Fan Club! Loosen your bow-tie, 
Poindexter, it's cutting off the blood 
to your brain. 

LISA 


If it's any comfort, Dad, I don't think 


the teachers have much respect for Ned. 
My teacher smokes in class now, and she 


let us watch TV for two hours while she 


went out to get her car tuned up. 

MARGE 
I feel bad for poor Seymour Skinner. He 
must be very sad and lonely. 

BART 
He's not sad and lonely! I saw him in 
the laundromat, and he asked me to come 
over to his house and hang out. (OFF 
THEIR LOOKS) What? What? 


EXT. SKINNER'S HOUSE - DAY 


Skinner's Mother opens the door. 


30. 


BART 


I'm here to see Principal Skinner. 


SKINNER'S MOTHER 


What? Oh, wait, he left me a note... 


(READING) "Mother, my friend Bart will 
be visiting this afternoon." Well, 
Seymour's up in his room. Don't touch 
the wallpaper. 


INT. SKINNER'S HOUSE - SKINNER'S ROOM - A MINUTE LATER 


Bart comes in. Principal Skinner is pretending to conduct 
an orchestra as CLASSICAL MUSIC BLARES from a reel-to-reel 
tape player. 


SKINNER 
Bum-ba-bum-bum! Ba-ba-ba-bum! (SEES 
BART) Oh, Bart! Welcome! Can I offer 
you a Diet Caffeine-Free Dr. Pepper or 


an individual fruit cocktail? 


BART 


No thanks. Hey, what's this? 


Bart is looking at a framed display of Skinner's Vietnam 
mementos (photos, medals, etc.). 


SKINNER 


(RE: PHOTO) Why, that's my old unit 


from Vietnam. I was their Sergeant, 


they were my loyal troops. 


We see the unit is full of hostile 19 year-olds who glare 
angrily at the square-looking Skinner. 


SKINNER (CONT'D) 


That photo was taken shortly before I 
was shot in the back... Which was 


strange, because I was in the Mess Hall 


at the time. 

SKINNER'S MOTHER (O.S.) 
Seymour! Your friend is here! 

SKINNER 
I know, Mother. 

SKINNER'S MOTHER (O.S.) 
Seymour, do you want me to tell you when 
it's 7330? 

SKINNER 
No, Mother. (TO BART) Mother seems to 
be in one of her talkative moods. Let's 


go out to the patio. 


EXT. SKINNER'S HOUSE - PATIO - DUSK 


Skinner stands at a barbecue grill wearing an apron that 
reads "Principals Do It 9 Months A Year." 


window, 


Through the 


31. 


we can see Skinner's Mother quietly sitting in her 


rocking chair. 


SKINNER 
(UPROARIOUS LAUGHTER) And you say Ned 
Flanders actually ate the cookies you 
left in the faculty lounge?! 

BART 
Yep, he didn't even check for cigarette 
butts. 


SKINNER 


32) 


(CHUCKLES) Any good principal knows to 


throw students' gifts in the trash 


immediately. That place must be falling 


apart. (BEAT) Nobody's mentioned me, 
have they? 

BART 
I thought I heard someone say your name 
in the cafeteria, but they might've been 
saying "skim milk." 

SKINNER 


(SATISFIED) Hmm. 


He takes the hot dogs off the grill and puts them on a 
flimsy paper plate. They all slide off and fall to the 
ground, where they roll across the patio. He picks them up 
and puts them in buns. 


SKINNER (CONT'D) 


Mother, your hot dogs are ready. 
EXT. SCHOOL - PLAYGROUND - DAY 


Ned strolls across the playground and up to Mrs. Krabappel 
and the kids, who are having class outside. Most of the 
kids are running around, playing on the monkey bars, etc. 


NED 

Edna, have you seen Miss Hoover around? 
MRS. KRABAPPEL 

She went to see that new martial arts 


movie in Chinatown, so I'm teaching her 


class, too. They're over there. 


We see Miss Hoover's class gathered around a nearby ice 
cream truck. 


335 


NED 
Jim Dandy. Everybody havin' fun? 
KIDS 


Yaaaaay! 


A paddy wagon drives up. Lou gets out and opens the back 
door. Lots of excited, dirty kids stream out. 


LOU 


We found these kids playin' in the 


quarry. They say they're Mr. Bennett's 
class. 
MONTAGE of Bart and Skinner together. 


1) INT. ITALIAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT 


Principal Skinner walks in with Bart. 


SKINNER 
I thought you might like this 


restaurant, Bart. They'll make a pizza 


pie with the topping of your choice. 


They are greeted by a stereotypical Italian chef, a la the 
one on a pizza box. 


ITALIAN CHEF 
Ay, Seymour! You want-a your usual 
table? 

SKINNER 


No, no, Luigi, I'd like one with two 


seats. I'll be dining with a friend 
tonight. 


ITALIAN CHEF 


34. 


(WAY TOO HAPPY) Ay! Good-a for you!! 
The chef seats them and goes into the kitchen. 
SKINNER 
They treat you real nice here. 
ITALIAN CHEF (0.S.) 
Ay, Salvatore! Guess-a who's here? Mr. 
Cuckoo Labonza, and-a some real ugly 
kid! 


2) EXT. CARNIVAL - HAUNTED HOUSE RIDE - DAY 


Bart and Principal Skinner get in the little cart and ride 
into the haunted house. 


INT. HAUNTED HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 


A cheesy teenage Dracula jumps out of a coffin. 


DRACULA 


(SQUEAKY TEENAGE VOICE) Blah! I've 


come to suck your blood! 


BART 
(SCREAM) 

DRACULA 
(SEEING SKINNER) (SCREAM) Principal 
Skinner! I apolo-lologize for scaring 
you. 

SKINNER 


No need, Jeremy. As a patron of the 
haunted house, I expect to be scared. 
DRACULA 


Oh, okay. (TIMID) Blah! 


3D: 


The cart moves along, and we s the cheesy teenage Wolfman, 
Mummy, Frankenstein, etc., all looking apprehensive and un- 
scary as Skinner approaches. 


INT. SCHOOL - HALLWAY - THE NEXT DAY 


Ned is walking down the hallway. He hears something strange 
and opens the door to a classroom. 


INT. SCHOOL - CLASSROOM - CONTINUOUS 


Ned enters to see the students sitting attentively at their 
desks. There is no teacher, only a portable radio sitting 
on the teacher's desk. 


RADIO (V.O.) 


KBBL News time, 10:35. Traffic and 


weather after this word, from AAMCO. 
(TWO CAR HORN HONKS) Hi, I'm Claude 
Akins. Cold weather means slow going 
for your automatic transmission... 

NED 
Where is your teacher? 

ROD 
He's in Chicago. 

NED 
(FED UP) That's it. I am not going to 


put up with this one second longer. 


INT. SCHOOL - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS 


A determined Ned strides down the hallway. As he passes the 
Xerox room, we ZOOM INSIDE TO SEE... 


INT. SCHOOL - XEROX ROOM - CONTINUOUS 


Bart sits on the Xerox machine with his pants down. We see 
hundreds of photocopies of his butt coming out. He pulls up 


36. 


his pants and SNICKERS as he takes the copies, turns them 
upside down, opens the machine, and puts them in the paper 
tray. He leaves just as a secretary enters with a stack of 
files. 


INT. SCHOOL - PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - A LITTLE LATER 


A stern-looking Ned is speaking to Miss Hoover and Mrs. 
Krabappel. The secretary walks in and sets some Xeroxes on 
Ned's desk. 


NED 
And from now on, I want you teaching 
class, assigning homework, and showing 


me the respect this office deserves. 


Ned picks up a Xerox and looks at it. On the back, we see 
Bart's butt. The teachers start CHUCKLING. Ned sees th 
butt and becomes incensed. 


INT. SCHOOL - PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - LATER 
NED 


I don't know what I'm going to do about 


the 300 copies that were sent to the 
School Board, but I do know one thing -- 
you will be punished. 
BART 
Say, Ned, somebody told me you used to 
play the piano... 
Bart reaches to take a piece of candy. Ned slaps his hand. 
NED 
(WISE TO BART'S SCHEME) Oh, no, no, no. 
We're talking about your punishment. 
You will give me 2 months detention and 


a 1,000 word essay on responsibility. 


STs 


And now you will go back to class. 
Bart leaves, looking very shaken. 
INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - BART'S ROOM - NIGHT 
Bart sits at his desk, trying to write something. He 


crumples it up, throws it out, and starts again. Homer 
walks by. 


BART 
Dad, do you know anything about 
responsibility? 

HOMER 


No... Why? 


We see Homer is carrying an upside-down box labelled "Wine 
Glasses - This Side Up." 


BART 
Because Ned is making me write this 
stupid essay. Plus, he gave me 2 months 
detention. 

HOMER 


What?! Flanders cannot tell my family 


what to do! The only people who tell my 
family what to do are me, Marge, and 
Lyndon LaRouche. 

BART 
But Flanders is the principal. 

HOMER 
Well, I'm head of the PTA, and I order 


you to disobey Flanders, and if you 


don't, I will punish you even more. 


38. 


BART 
So either way, I get punished. 
HOMER 
Yes. The lesson here is that you 
deserve to be punished. 


EXT. SCHOOL - MIDNIGHT 


Principal Skinner stands in front of the empty school, 
looking wistful. He wipes away a tear as we hear his mental 
sound montage of: SCHOOL BELLS, CHILDREN PLAYING, FRAGMENTED 
P.A. ANNOUNCEMENTS, ETC. We move down the street to see 
Professor Frink standing wistfully in front of his old lab. 
We hear his mental sound montage of: WEIRD SCIENTIFIC 
GIZMOS, ROBOTS, ETC. We move much, much further down the 
street to see Nixon staring wistfully at the White House. 

We hear his mental sound montage of: CHEERING CROWDS, "HAIL 
TO THE CHIEF," AND FRANTIC CHIMPANZEE SOUNDS FOLLOWED BY A 
GUNSHOT. 


EXT. SKINNER'S HOUSE - THE NEXT DAY 
Bart KNOCKS on the door and Skinner's mother answers. 
SKINNER'S MOM 
Oh, you're Seymour's friend. Here, he 
left you this note. 


Bart opens the note, which is in Skinner's incredibly neat 
handwriting. 


SKINNER (V.O.) 
"Dear Bart, I do wish our friendship had 
more time to grow. However, now that 
Ned has the school under control, I feel 
there is little chance of my being asked 


back, and frankly, I feel quite useless. 


Hence, I've decided to return to the 


IKs 


only other thing that has given my life 
meaning -- I've re-enlisted in the 
United States Army. Sincerely, Sgt. 
Seymour Skinner." 

Bart looks heartbroken. He turns to Skinner's Mom. 

SKINNER'S MOM 

Don't worry about me. I've got two 
other sons. 


The two sons come to the door. They both resemble Skinner, 
except one is fat and the other is muscular with a beard. 


SKINNER'S BROTHER #1 


Everything okay, Mom? Who's this? 
SKINNER'S MOM 
He's one of Seymour's friends. 


SKINNER'S BROTHER #2 


God, Seymour is weird. 


FADE OUT: 


END OF ACT TWO 


FADE IN: 


ACT THREE 


EXT. FORT SPRINGFIELD - DAY 


Skinner, now in drill sergeant uniform, is being shown 
around by a 26 year-old Colonel. 


COLONEL 


It's good to have another combat veteran 


around here. I myself received a number 


of medals for securing the Montgomery 


Ward in Kuwait City. 


SKINNER 


Yes. Now, I understand it will be my 


duty to mold the new recruits into a 


well-disciplined, highly-trained 


infantry unit. 

COLONEL 
Sure, whatever, I guess. Here they 
come. 


A bus drives up, 
sizes pour out. 


Where do 


and teenage hayseeds of all shapes and 


HAYSEED #1 
I get my grenades at? 


HAYSEED #2 


Hey, they don't have them group terlets 


no more, 


do they? 


40. 


41. 


INT. SCHOOL - PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - TWO DAYS LATER 


Homer and Marge sit in front of Ned's desk. 
NED 
Homer, Marge, I know you're doing your 
best, but sometimes when kids act up, 
there's a problem at home. God knows, I 
caused my parents no end of trouble when 
I was a boy. 


NED'S FLASHBACK - NEW YORK - 1959 


Five year-old Ned is playing with a bottle of ink and spills 
it all over a desk. Ned's father storms in -- he is a 
beatnik who resembles Ned, but has a goatee and a beret. 


NED'S FATHER 


(DICK SHAWN VOICE) Oh maaaan! Ned 


spilled ink all over my poems! He's a 


real flat tire, I mean a cube, man! 


He's putting us on the train to 
Squaresville, Mona! 

NED'S MOTHER 
(PICKING UP NED) Come on, Neddy-oO. 
Let's go steal some clothes from the 
N.Y.U. laundry. 

BACK TO REALITY 

MARGE 
We've found that Bart doesn't respond 
well to punishment. He responds better 


to rewards. Candy and whatnot. 


42. 


NED 
I'm sorry, but the punishment stands. 
HOMER 
(REALLY STEAMED) Oh yeah?! Well, let 
me tell you something, Flanders! Bart is 


going to ignore your punishment! I am 


going to drive you out of this office! 

And Marge is going to... make those 

delicious marshmallow squares of hers! 
MARGE 

(VERY FIRM) Yes I am! 


They storm out of Ned's office. 


INT. SCHOOL - CLASSROOM - NIGHT 


The PTA meeting is about to begin. Parents and teachers sit 
in the kids' desks. Homer stands in front of the group. 
HOMER 


Welcome to the monthly meeting of the 
PTA. There's no need to wait for 
Flanders. He's not coming tonight. 


EXT. FLANDERS HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - SIMULTANEOUS 


Ned and Maude sit in their car, looking puzzled. The 
steering wheel is missing. 


NED 


Well, I guess I could try to drive, but 


it wouldn't be very safe. 


BACK TO SCENE 


HOMER 


Okay, item one: the impeachment of Ned 
Flanders. All in favor? 
A BEAT OF SILENCE as Homer looks expectant. 
DR. HIBBERT 
Wait a minute, let's discuss this. 
HOMER 
(ANNOYED GRUNT) 
CHIEF WIGGUM 
(SKEPTICAL) What's wrong with Ned 
Flanders? He's a good egg. 
HOMER 


(GETTING VERY NERVOUS) Ned Flanders 


has, you know, been punishing my son, 


you know, and there's that other stuff 


he did, like, that stuff, you know? 
CHUCK'S DAD 
I've heard nothing but praise for Ned 
Flanders. He's a man in a very 
difficult position. 
HOMER 


(WHINY) Please just do me one favor and 


fire Ned Flanders. 
DR. HIBBERT 


That is an absurd request. I suggest we 


fire you and put an end to your brutish 
behavior. All in favor? 


EVERYONE 


44, 


Aye! 

HOMER 
(GENUINELY PANICKED) Egad! They've put 
an end to my brutish behavior! 


EXT. FORT SPRINGFIELD - TRAINING GROUNDS - DAY 


Skinner's company jogs along with him out front. 
COMPANY 
(SINGING) I met a woman in Paris, 
France / Had a big hole in her underpa - 


Skinner looks very shocked and CALLS THE COMPANY TO A HALT. 
He goes up to a soldier and YELLS in his face, drill 
sergeant style. 


SKINNER 
Where did you pick up that filth, 
private?! 

PRIVATE 
We heard Sergeant Clark's company 


Singing it, sir! 


SKINNER 
Well, there will be no smut in my 
company. You're in this army to learn! 
SMASH CUT TO: 
EXT. FORT SPRINGFIELD - TRAINING GROUNDS - LATER 
Skinner's company jogs along with him out front. 
COMPANY 


(SINGING) I don't know, but I been 


45. 


told! / The Parthenon is mighty old! 
SKINNER 

(SINGING) Howwww old? 
COMPANY 


(SINGING) Real old! 


SKINNER 
(SINGING) That's good, but needs 
improvement. 


INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 


Bart is looking sadly at a letter he's received from 
Skinner. Enclosed is a photo of Skinner standing stiffly in 
uniform. Bart SIGHS. 


LISA 


Wow, I never thought Principal Skinner 


could become any more of a square, but 
there's the proof. 


BART 


It's weird, Lis. I miss him asa 


friend, but I miss him even more as an 


enemy. Flanders is too even-tempered to 
be a good enemy. 
LISA 


What about Moe? 


Bart considers this, then picks up the phone and calls Moe. 
(INTERCUT BETWEEN BART AND MOE) 


BART 
I'd like to speak to Mrs. Lintercourse. 


Her first name is Norma. 


MOE 
Hey, is anybody here familiar with Norma 
Lintercourse? (BEAT) No? Sorry, buddy, 
you've called the wrong place if you're 
looking for Norma Lintercourse. 

BART 


(HANGING UP) Eh, it lacks that certain 


thrill that comes with irritating a man 


down to his very core. 

LISA 
I think you need Skinner. Everybody 
needs a good enemy. Holmes had his 
Moriarty. Mountain Dew has its Mello- 
Yello. Even Maggie has that baby with 


the one eyebrow. 


Reveal that Maggie is glaring furiously out the window as 


the one-eyebrowed baby passes by in his carriage. He glares 


back. We hear a SINISTER MUSICAL STING. 


EXT. FORT SPRINGFIELD - FRONT GATE - DAY 


A sign says "Fort Springfield -- Proud Home of Secret 
Civilian Mail-Opening Project." A sentry with very thick 
glasses stands at the gate. He does not appear to notice as 


Bart rides his bike right past him. 


EXT. FORT SPRINGFIELD - MORTAR RANGE - A MINUTE LATER 


Skinner's men are FIRING MORTARS. SHELLS EXPLODE at 


the far 
end of the range. Suddenly, Bart appears over the horizon, 


riding his bike across the range towards them. Before 
Skinner has a chance to stop them, the men drop another 


round in their mortars. 
SKINNER 


Man on the range!! Change your 


47. 


trajectories!! 


The men quickly swing the mortars around, just as they 
LAUNCH. 


EXT. QUIK-E-MART - THAT MINUTE 
Apu stands proudly outside with Sanjay as a tanker truck 


pumps gasoline into the ground. There are several rows of 
shiny new gas pumps out front. 


APU 
Sixteen brand new gas pumps! At last we 
can compete with the Gas & Gulp! 


We hear the WHISTLING OF APPROACHING SHELLS. Apu and Sanjay 
look up. 


EXT. FORT SPRINGFIELD - A MINUTE LATER 


Bart and Skinner walk along. 
BART 
If there was some way to get rid of 
Flanders, would you want to come back? 
SKINNER 
I can't say I don't miss the school. 
And frankly, the Army isn't quite as I 


remembered it. 


A group of rowdy soldiers RUMBLE BY in a tank. A soldier 
standing on top of the tank moons Skinner. Another one 
throws a beer can at him. 


ROWDY SOLDIER 
Up yours, sergeant! 
SKINNER 
Actually, it's exactly as I remembered 


TEZ? (BEAT) I do want to come back, 


Bart, but it doesn't sound like Flanders 
is going to get fired. 

BART 
Yeah, but we could make him quit! We 


could drive him crazy -- just like I 


drove you crazy! 
SKINNER 
YES. (WARMING TO THE IDEA) Then I 
could just show up and take my old job 
back! 
BART 
-rves. 


SKINNER 


Now you realize, if we both get what we 


want, and I become Principal again, we 
can no longer be friends. 

BART 
(A BIT SAD) Yeah, it wouldn't be right: 
you, a principal, and me, a 
troublemaker. 

SKINNER 
Then let's end our friendship with 
something really special. (PUTTING HIS 
ARM AROUND BART) How would you like to 
join me for some real Army ice cream? 


INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - BART'S ROOM - NIGHT 


Bart paces nervously as Homer sits eagerly on the bed. 


49. 
Skinner walks in with a briefcase and several large, rolled- 
up documents. 
SKINNER 
(RE: HOMER) What's he doing here? 
BART 
When he found out we were going to drive 


Ned Flanders crazy, he insisted on 


helping. 

SKINNER 
Very well. (UNROLLING DOCUMENTS) I have 
two plans. The first: we nail all the 


school furniture to the ceiling and 
convince Ned that the building is 
upside-down. This will work better if 
we can persuade the children to somehow 
walk on the ceiling. 

BART 
(DUBIOUS) Uh-huh. What's the second 
plan? 

SKINNER 


We enroll Ned in a number of book and 


record clubs. Given time, this could 


cause him financial hardship and mental 


anguish. 
HOMER 
But how long is that gonna take? He 


could stay in that job for years, 


50. 


lingering on the brink of insanity. 
Just like you did. 
SKINNER 
You're right. Perhaps we need 10, no, 
20 plans, all working together in a 
symphony of embarrassment and annoyance! 
BART 


Yes! Tomorrow, we must create a day so 


stressful that no principal could ever 


last through it! 


Bart opens a file cabinet labelled "Scheduled Pranks: 1994- 
2014" and hands out piles of file folders. 


MARGE (O.S.) 
(KNOCKING ON DOOR) What's going on in 
there? 

BART / HOMER / SKINNER 
Nothing! 


MONTAGE - LATE THAT NIGHT 


1) Bart is talking on the phone. We see split screens of 
him talking to: a sleepy Chalmers who nods his head "Yes"; 
an obviously drunk and confused Mayor Quimby; and Bumblebee 
Man, who looks very enthusiastic -- but then looks at his 
calendar and sadly shakes his head "No." 


2) Skinner stands in front of the school going over a set 
of blueprints with the Old Sea Captain. He points to 
various strategic locations and the Captain nods. The 
Captain SNAPS HIS FINGERS and his men begin wheeling crates 
full of large, dead fish into the school. 


3) Homer trains several local actors who vaguely resembl 
Ned Flanders. 


HOMER 


odz 


No! Not "Howdy-doody," -- "Howdly- 
doodly!" 


ACTORS 


(FLANDERS IMITATION) Howdly-doodly. 
EXT. SCHOOL - STREET - MORNING 
Students are pouring into the school. Skinner and Homer sit 


in a car across the street and watch as Flanders drives into 
the parking lot. Skinner looks at his watch. 


SKINNER 
8:56. In 4 minutes, Ned Flanders will 
begin the most traumatic day of his 


life. 


Ned starts walking up the school steps just as 
Superintendent Chalmers arrives with his assistant, Leopold. 


NED 
Superintendent, I'm glad you're here. 
I've been wrestlin' with how to tell you 
this, but, well, it seems a publisher 
wants to buy my novel. It's about a 
young lawyer who joins a prestigious 
Southern law firm, only to find out it's 
really run by -- Well, that's not 
important. What is, is that I quit. 
PAN DOWN to reveal a thunderstruck Bart, who has just walked 


up with Santa's Little Helper and four other excited dogs on 
leashes. 


SUPERINTENDENT CHALMERS 
But, Ned -- 


NED 


I2 


I'm sorry. I'm gonna have to go ona 
book tour, there's talk of a screenplay, 
and frankly, I'd like to spend some time 
with my family. Thanks for a great 
opportunity. Good-bye. 


Ned gets into his car and drives away. Bart makes a frantic 
"What now?" gesture to Skinner and Homer, who come running 
over. Homer is wearing a fake moustache and a uniform that 
says "Grimaldi Paving." 


SUPERINTENDENT CHALMERS 
Seymour, what are you doing here? I 
thought you flipped out and joined the 
army. 

SKINNER 
Now I'm back to run the school! (TO 


STUDENTS) Dirksen, tuck in your shirt. 


Jaffee, spit out that gum. 
LEOPOLD 
(TO CHALMERS) He can't just stroll in 
here and take his job back. 
SUPERINTENDENT CHALMERS 


(DOESN'T CARE) Eh. He seems to know 


the students' names. 


Superintendent Chalmers and Leopold walk away. Skinner, 
Bart, and Homer look happy. 


BART 


So I guess we're enemies again. 


SKINNER 


Yes. Yes we are. Now wipe that smirk 


53.5 


off your face and get back to class. 
HOMER 
Do you still want me to fill Flanders's 
car with hot asphalt? 
SKINNER 


(BEAT) If you can catch up with him. 


Homer runs off gleefully. A steam shovel pulls up in front 


of the school. A second later, a flatbed truck with a 
banner reading "Mobile Oktoberfest" drives up. A brass band 
on the back STRIKES UP the "Beer Barrel Polka." A group of 
scraggly prospectors run up the steps with their burro. 


PROSPECTOR 
(GABBY HAYES VOICE) The man on the 
phone said the gold was buried under the 


Principal's Office! 


There are TWO MUFFLED EXPLOSIONS from underground, as two 
giant weather balloons burst out of the lawn and inflate on 


either side of Skinner. One balloon reads "GET." The other 
reads "BENT." Skinner assumes a "Rocky" victory stance. 
SKINNER 


Ah! It's great to be back! 
INT. SCHOOL - PRINCIPAL'S OUTER OFFICE - DAY 
CHYRON: "TWO MONTHS LATER" 


Bart sits calmly on the sofa. Skinner's office door opens, 
and Milhouse comes out, shaken. 


SKINNER 


The toilet paper is there for personal 


Sanitary use, and for no other purpose! 


Is that clear? Simpson, you're next. 


Bart goes into the office and comes out a moment later with 
a confident smile. 


MILHOUSE 


Hey, I get three weeks detention, 


54. 


and 


you don't get anything? What, are you 


still friends with him? 


BART 


Nuh-uh. (SLY) All I did was promise to 


keep a little secret. 


Bart takes a piece of paper out of his pocket and unfolds 
it. We FREEZE FRAME to see it is a "WANTED" poster with a 


photo of Skinner and the caption "A.W.O.L. 
Skinner -- Wanted for Desertion." 


THE END 


-- Sgt. Seymour 


FADE OUT:

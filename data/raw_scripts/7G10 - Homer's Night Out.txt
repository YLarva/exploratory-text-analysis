HOMER 
The frosting on the cake was 
(INDICATING WITH FINGERS) this thick. 
And Eugene Fisk, my poor sucker of an 
assistant, didn't know the fruit punch 
was spiked. And he really made an ass 
of himself putting the moves on the new 
girl in Valve Maintenance. (CHUCKLES) 

MARGE 
Does this girl like him? 

HOMER 
Pffft. I have to warn you, Marge -- I 
think the poor young thing has the hots 
for yours truly. 

MARGE 
Homer! 

HOMER 
(CHUCKLES) Just keepin' you on your

Homer steps on the scale. 

HOMER 
(GASPS) Two-hundred-thirty-nine 
pounds?! I'm a blimp! Why are all the 
good things so tasty? From now on,

pictures. 
BART 
Ah, baloney. Geez!

girl in Valve Maintenance. 
MARGE 
Homer, is this some kind of stag party? 
HOMER 
No, no, Marge. It's going to be very 
classy, a tea-and-crumpets kind of 
thing. 
MARGE 
Hmmmm. Eugene Fisk? Isn't he your 
assistant? 
HOMER 
No! (QUIETLY) My supervisor.

The Mail Carrier shoves a package at a very surprised Bart. 
He tears open the package and digs through various layers 
of wrapping material until he gets to a very small box 
which contains a camera the size of a matchbox. 
BART 
Oh thanks. mam. Whoa, man. Look at

The room has a nautical theme. Gathered around a long

WORKERS. Everyone, except the Fisks, is drinking grog and 
beer out of oversized mugs. The Fisks are wearing nice 
suits; the others are in shirt-sleeves. Mr. Fisk is 


standing next to Eugene at the head of the table, making a 
toast with a discreet glass of sherry.

MR. FISK 
And just as I was asking myself, "Where 
did my seven-year-old boy get the money 
for a Father's Day present?", I opened 
the box, and inside was little Eugene's 
baseball glove. He had given me the 
one thing that mattered most to him in 
the whole world. Eugene, when I see 
you, the one thing that matters most to 
me in the whole world, married 
tomorrow, I'm going to know just how 
you felt that day. 

EUGENE 
I love you, Dad. 

MR. FISK 


I love you, son.

removable letters read "COD PLATTER $4.95." An obsequious 
WAITER wearing a sailor suit is talking to Bart. We hear 
muffled SINGING in the background.

Homer sits at the bar next to BARNEY, glumly nursing a 
drink. MOE is behind the bar. A sign behind the bar reads 
"Ladies Night: Unescorted Ladies Drink Free." As a result, 
there's a middle-aged WOMAN in an overcoat at the bar 
tonight. 
MOE 
What's the matter, Homer? Hottest 
Ladies Night in months and you're not 
even checking out the action. 
HOMER 
Oh, Moe. My wife gave me the old 
heave-ho because of some lousy picture. 
MOE

Moe points to the wall, where a xerox copy of the photo

The place is a mess, with dirty clothes lying on the floor

porch, and dishes stacked in the sink. On the wall is a 
faded and peeling Farrah Fawcett-Majors poster. Homer 
stares sadly out the window. 
BARNEY 
If you get hungry in the middle of the 
night, there's an open beer in the 
fridge. 
Barney joins Homer at the window. Homer points outside. 
HOMER 
Look, Barney. See the row of tiny 
lights up there? The middle one is my 
house. Someone must have left the 
porch light on. 
BARNEY 
Hey, that's rough, pal. 


Homer continues to stare out the window. Barney goes over

clock-punching ilk. And yet, I've led 
a solitary life. The fair sex remains

I'm tired.

bad lesson. Your boy idolizes you.

Oh, he does not!

Yes he does, Homer. And when he sees 
you treating women as objects, he's

your son better than that, Homer. 
HOMER 
So what should I do, Marge? 
MARGE 
Well, I think you should take Bart to 
meet this exotic belly-person. I want 
him to see that she's a real human

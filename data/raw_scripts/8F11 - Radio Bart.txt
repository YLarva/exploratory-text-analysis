ACT ONE 


FADE IN: 
INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 


LISA is dancing in front of the TV to a grinding GUITAR 
RIFF. HOMER walks past the doorway, sees Lisa and smiles. 


HOMER 
Aw, ain’t that cute... Hey! 
Lisa has started to swivel her hips sinuously. 
HOMER (CONT’D) 
Where in God’s name did you learn that 
kind of... (NOTICES TV; AROUSED) 
daaaanncciinng! 
On the TV screen, the dance show features lots of floor- 
level shots of undulating TEENAGE GIRLS. Homer stares at 
the screen, open-mouthed. A CLOSE UP of his eyes shows the 
reflection of a dancing GIRL. PAN DOWN and see drool coming 
out of his mouth which also bears the reflection of a 
@ancing girl. 
HOMER 
(SHUDDERS, MOANS, ETC.) 
LISA 
Dad, can I have some money to buy Bart 
a birthday present? 
HOMER 


(MESMERIZED) Mon-ey.

He takes out his wallet and hands Lisa a pile of money. 
Lisa sticks her head between Homer’s face and the TV 
screen. 
LISA 
Dad, this is a hundred and ten dollars. 
HOMER 
(OBLIVIOUS) Oh, sorry. 
He hands her more money. 
ON TV 
On screen a Don Cornelius type M.C. comes on. 
M.C. 
That’s very righteous. Funky C Funky 
Do will be back to lip sync another one 
of their hits, right after this. 
A commercial from the ’70’s comes on. The film is scratchy 
and pops a little. A BOY sits forlornly in front of his 
television while other KIDS play happily outside his 
window. 
TV ANNOUNCER (V.O.) 
Hey kids! Why sit in front of the TV, 
when you can be on the radio!? 
With a magical PING (and an obvious stop-motion video 
effect), a microphone appears in the boy’s hand and the TV 
turns into a cheap-looking AM radio. The boy is amazed and 
delighted. 
SMASH CUT TO: 
The boy SINGING into the microphone. His voice comes out 


the radio. The other kids are now in the room, dancing 
wildly. 


8F11 FINAL DELIVERY 6/28/91 


BOY 
(SINGING) And later that night/ When 
his lights went out of sight/ Came the 


wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald! 
ON HOMER 
Looking impressed. 
HOMER 
That could be Bart! 
TV ANNOUNCER (V.O.) 
Throw away your bulky transmitters and 
broadcasting towers... 
The commercial shows a radio transmitter being tossed into 
a kitchen wastebasket. The hands dust themselves off ina 
"Good Riddance" gesture. A picture of a broadcast tower 
has a flashing "X" superimposed. 
TV ANNOUNCER (V.O. CONT’D) 
The SuperStar celebrity microphone lets 
you hear your voice through any AM 
radio! 
The scene shifts to a TEENAGER with long hair driving ina 
convertible with several other BOYS. He talks through the 
car radio to two teenage GIRLS walking on the sidewalk. 
TEENAGER 
Hey good lookin’, we’ll be back to pick 
you up later. 
The girls GIGGLE. The car drives away. 
HOMER 
(ADMIRING WHISTLE) He’s in for some 


lovin’. 


8F11 FINAL DELIVERY 6/28/91 


TV ANNOUNCER (V.0.) 
It’s a perfect gift for birthdays, 
graduations, weddings. 


On screen we see a BRIDE at the altar with a mic. 


BRIDE 
(ON MIC) I do! 
HOMER 
Hn... Bart’s birthday’s coming up. 


TV ANNOUNCER (V.0.) 
But order now, supply is limited. 
HOMER 

(GASPS) Limited?! 


Homer dials the phone, he crosses his fingers and closes 
his eyes. 


HOMER (CONT’D) 
(INTO PHONE, URGENT) Do you have any of 
those microphones left? 

INT. WAREHOUSE 


The OPERATOR looks behind him. We see huge stacks of 
boxes, each labeled "Microphone". 


OPERATOR 
(INTO PHONE) Yeah, a couple.

INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY 
SUPER: SIX TO EIGHT WEEKS LATER 
BART stands against the closet door WHISTLING "Happy 
Birthday to me". He wears a "Kiss Me, It’s My Birthday" 
button. Homer traces the squiggly top of Bart’s head and 


marks the line "Bart, age 10". On the TV is KRUSTY THE 
CLOWN. 


8F11 FINAL DELIVERY 6/28/91 


ON TV 
KRUSTY 
Okay, Sideshow Mel, bring out the 
birthday cake! 
MEL staggers out with a huge cake. Krusty trips him. Mel 
drops the cake and falls to his hands and knees. Krusty 
plants his foot on Mel’s butt and pushes his face into the 
cake. Mel’s hair catches fire from the candles. The KIDS 
CHEER. 
KRUSTY (CONT’D) 
Don’t blame me, I didn’t do it! 
(LAUGHS) Hey kids, while Sideshow Mel 
mops up, let’s see the names of our 
Krusty birthday pals for today! 
Bart runs from Homer and sits in front of the TV. 
BART 
All right! Here comes my name! 
Hundreds of names, including Bart’s, whip by on the screen. 
BART (CONT’D) 
Wow, best eight bucks I ever spent. 
Bart holds up a wad of coupons. 
BART (CONT’D) 
And now I’m off to hit forty-six local

EXT. WALL E. WEASEL’S - ESTABLISHING 
In front of the building a giant weasel in a chef’s hat 
holds up a pizza. The company slogan is "We cram fun down 
your throat". 
INT. WALL E. WEASEL’S - GAME ROOM 
Bart’s friends play the games and ride the rides. NELSON 
crawls up the Skee-Ball lane and drops his balls into the 
center hole. A MAN in a weasel outfit, carrying a pizza, 
fights his way through the KIDS, who grab at him. Nelson 
LAUGHS. 
KIDS 
It’s Wally! Hey Wally, do something 
funny! 
WEASEL 
(HARRIED) Hey, later, okay... hey, why 
don’t you go bug your parents? 
Bart is standing by the video games. 
BART 
Cool, Larry the Looter! 
He puts in a quarter. On screen, LARRY the Looter walks 
past a burning overturned police car, picks up a garbage 
can and throws it at a store window. The window BREAKS and 
a BURGLAR ALARM rings. 
BART (CONT‘D) 
(CHUCKLE) All right! Stick it to the 
Man. 
Larry climbs into the store and starts grabbing TVs and 
stereos, which turn into point values. Bart MOANS as 


BARKING attack dogs enter the screen. He tries to fight 
them off but they bring him down, ripping open his throat.

Bart is talking to an audio-animatronic weasel who is not 
looking at him as it talks. 


ROBOT WEASEL 
Hey there, I hear it’s your birthday. 
How old are you? 
BART 
Well, I’m -- 
ROBOT WEASEL 
(CUTTING HIM OFF) That’s great! Would 
you like us to sing you a special song? 
BART 
Hell, no. 
ROBOT WEASEL 
You got it! Ready, Senor Beaver-otti? 
SENOR BEAVER-OTTI 
(ITALIAN ACCENT) I’m-a ready. And-a 
one and-a two... 
The beaver conductor bangs his tail on the floor. As the 
cheap audio-animatronic animals on the wall sing, CLACKING 
of their plastic parts drowns out the song. 
ROBOT ANIMALS 
(SINGING) You’re the Birthday/ You’re 
the Birthday/ You’re the Birthday boy 
or girl. 
The beaver conductor’s tail falls off. Sparks fly out. The 
guy in the weasel suit runs in with a fire extinguisher and 


sprays the beaver’s sparking tail.

INT. WALL E. WEASEL - PARTY AREA - LATER 
Bart is sitting at a table. He opens a present marked "From 
Aunt Patty and Aunt Selma". SELMA takes his picture. We 
FLASH and freeze frame on Bart’s disappointed face. 
BACK TO SCENE 
BART 
Wha th...? 
PATTY 
It’s a label maker. 
SELMA 
Mmm-hmm. We have one at home. Before 
we got it I was always finding Patty’s 
stubble in my leg razor. 
BART 
Ehhh... 
Bart makes a label reading "THIS BITES" and puts it on the 
label maker. A series of photos follows, showing Bart 
unimpressed as he opens a pair of wool socks, an etiquette 
book and a small cactus plant. 
HOMER 
Open my present! Open my present! 
Bart opens the microphone. 
BART 
(UNIMPRESSED) Next. 
Bart tosses the microphone aside. Homer slumps. 
MARGE 
Bart! Be polite. 
BART 
(FLAT) Next, please. 


MARTIN hands Bart a beautifully wrapped present.

8F11 FINAL DELIVERY 6/28/91 


MARTIN 
Bart, I’ve noticed your birthday 
presents are a poor crop at best. Hope 
this turns the tide. 
He unwraps Martin’s present. It is a cap and blue blazer 
exactly like the ones Martin is wearing. The kids exchange 
dubious glances. PATTY and Selma OOH and AHH. 
PATTY 
Just gorgeous. 
MARTIN 
(TO BART) Now we can be twins! 
Bart looks like he’s been kicked in the stomach. 
INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - KITCHEN - EVENING 
Bart is putting labels everywhere that read "PROPERTY OF 
BART SIMPSON": on the microwave, on the ceiling, on the 
dog’s head. Homer opens the refrigerator. The only can of 
beer inside has one of the labels. 
HOMER 
(MOANS) There’s only one can of beer 
left and it’s Bart’s. 
Homer follows Bart. 
INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - BART‘’S BEDROOM 
HOMER 
Hey boy, how’s the microphone working? 
BART 


Fine. 


Homer spots the microphone, still in its cellophane-wrapped 
box, being used to prop open a window. 


10. 


8F11 FINAL DELIVERY 6/28/91 


HOMER 
Bart! I would love to get a present 
like that. 
BART 
Here you go. Enjoy. 
Bart hands him the microphone. 
HOMER 
(ANNOYED GRUNT) Listen, boy, this is a 
great invention! Watch. 
He grabs the microphone and drags Bart off. Bart YELPS. 
INT. SIMPSON HOUSE = LISA’S ROOM 


Homer sings to Lisa while Bart stands by. There is piercing 
FEEDBACK from the radio. Lisa covers her ears. 


HOMER 
(SINGING) The legend lives on from the 
Chippewa on down/ On the big lake they 
call Gitchee Goomee... 
LISA 
Quit it, Dad! 
Santa’s Little Helper HOWLS. 
INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - KITCHEN 


Marge is cooking. Bart walks in with Homer, who still 
holds the microphone.

8F11 FINAL DELIVERY 6/28/91 


MARGE 
Wha’d you say? I can’t understand you 
through all that distortion. 

HOMER 
All right, all right. Don’t panic. 
I’1l just call the customer service 


hotline. 


We see the back of the box reads "Customer Service Hotline 


KL5~-3719. 


Homer goes to the phone and dials. 


EXT. DESERT - DAY 


We see a phone booth. The phone inside RINGS a couple of 
times. A scruffy HITCHHIKER type answers the phone. 


INTERCUT 


HITCHHIKER 


Hello? 


HOMER 
Is this Klondike 5-3719? 
HITCHHIKER 
(LOOKING AT PHONE) Uh-yeah. 
HOMER 
Well, my microphone doesn’t work. 
HITCHHIKER 
Times are tough, man. (RUBBING NECK) 
Ya’ know, I just fell off the back of a 


pickup truck. 


Homer sadly hangs up and SIGHS. Marge looks worried.

8F11 FINAL DELIVERY 6/28/91 


INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - BART’S ROOM - A LITTLE LATER 
Bart, lying on his bed, throws Martin’s cap like a frisbee 
into his closet. Marge enters carrying the microphone and 
sits down next to him. 
MARGE 
You know, Bart, I don’t think this is 
such a bad present. Maybe you just 
shouldn’t talk into it as loud as your 
father does. 
She puts down the radio and talks into the microphone. 
MARGE (CONT’D) 
(INTO MIC) Testing... testing... One, 
two, three... Oh, my. Do I sound like 
that? 
BART 
(BRIGHTENING) Hey, it does work! 
MARGE 
I bet you could have a lot of fun with 
this. Why don’t you go show your 
father? 


She pats Bart’s head and leaves. Bart thinks, then grins 
slyly. 


BART 
(IMPISHLY) Hmmm. 
INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - KITCHEN 
Homer listens to MUSIC on the radio, over the following, as 
he hunts through the freezer. He finds a carton of

BART (V.O.) 
People of Earth, this is Bartron,

Resistance is useless.

HOMER 
Why, you little... 
Homer starts to strangle Bart. 
HOMER (CONT’D) 
(REALIZING) Wait a minute. Does this 
mean you like my present? 
BART 
(CHOKING) Yes, dad. 
HOMER 
AWW... 
He hugs Bart, who GASPS for air. 
HOMER 
Just promise me you won’t play anymore 
practical jokes. 
BART 
I promise. 


They hug again. Bart SLAPS a "Property of Bart Simpson" 
label on Homer’s butt. Bart CHUCKLES.

FADE IN: 
INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - MAGGIE’S ROOM - EVENING 
Marge is putting Maggie to bed. She takes the pacifier out 
of Maggie’s mouth, hangs it on a little hook, then starts 
to exit. Bart’s voice comes from the crib. 
BART (V.O.) 
(BABY VOICE) Mama! Mama! 
Marge runs back to the crib. 
MARGE 
Oh, Maggie! You talked! Can you say 
"mama" again? 
BART (V.O.) 
(BABY VOICE) Sorry lady, show’s over. 
MARGE

Oh, brotherrr. 
INT. SPRINGFIELD ELEMENTARY - BART’S CLASSROOM 
Bart holds his microphone and starts to make a FLATULENT 
NOISE with his hand on his mouth. In the front of the 
class MRS. KRABAPPEL sits down and we hear the noise coming 
from her chair. She looks mad. 
BART 
(MOCK HORROR) Mrs. Krabappel! That was 
uncalled for! 
In the back of the class, other KIDS congratulate Bart. 
MILHOUSE 
Bravo! 
NELSON 
Well done, old man. 
INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - BART’S ROOM - EVENING 
Bart looks out his window and sees ROD and TODD FLANDERS in 
their pajamas listening to the radio. Bart speaks into his 
microphone, and it cuts off the Christian broadcast where 
an organ was PLAYING. 
BART (V.0.) 
(MOCK DEEP VOICE) Rod... Todd... this 
is God. 
ROD 


How did you get on the radio?

Rod walks 


8F11 FINAL DELIVERY 6/28/91 


BART (V.O.) 
(EXPLODING) What do you mean, how did I 
get on the radio? I created the 
universe! Stupid kids. 

TODD 
(SCARED) Forgive my brother. We believe 
you. 

BART (V.O.) 
Talk is cheap. Perhaps a test of thy 
faith. Walk through the wall. I will 
remove it for you... 
into the wall. He BANGS his head. 

BART (V.0. CONT’D) 
.--later. 

TODD 
What do you want from us? 

BART (V.0.) 
I got a job for thee. Bring forth all 
the cookies from your kitchen and leave 
them in the backyard. And don’t turn 
back to look at ‘em or you know what. 

ROD 
But those cookies belong to our 
parents. 

BART (V.0O.) 
(EXASPERATED SIGH) Look, do you want a 


happy God or a vengeful God? 


18. 


8F11 FINAL DELIVERY 6/28/91 


ROD 
Happy God. 
BART (V.0.) 
Then quit flapping your lip and make

ROD/TODD 
Yes, sir. 
They run out of the roon. 
EXT. SPRINGFIELD ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - BACK FIELD - DAY 


Bart stands next to an open well. He lowers the radio into 
the well on some twine. 


BART 
(WHISTLING) 


Bart unexpectedly runs out of twine and the radio CLATTERS 
to the bottom. 


BART (CONT’D) 
Whoops! 
SCHOOL YARD 
GROUNDSKEEPER WILLIE HUMS a Scottish air as he waxes his 
tractor lawn mower, which has his name painted on it. He 
hears the noise. 
WILLIE 
Hoot mon! Sounds like trouble a- 
brewin’ at the old well. 
BACK AT THE WELL 
Bart has disappeared as Willie approaches. 
BART (V.0.) 
(PHONY VOICE) Help! Help! I fell 


down the well! 


19. 


8F11 FINAL DELIVERY 6/28/91 


WILLIE 
I’1ll get help, laddie! 
Willie takes a swig from a flask he carries. 
WILLIE (CONT’D) 
(TO HIMSELF) A little nip of courage. 
Willie runs across the street, almost getting hit by a car, 
hops on his riding mower and TAKES OFF down the road. The 
mower blades cover both lanes of the road. Cars slow down 
behind him and pull off to the side to avoid him. 
WILLIE (CONT’D) 
(TO CARS) Out of my way! Look out, you 


horse’s arse! 


Bart emerges from the bushes, with his mic, LAUGHING 
heartily. 


BART 
Sucker. 
INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON 
Homer looks outside while the kids watch TV. There are 
parked cars lining the road and people hurrying down the 
street. Homer goes to the door with a puzzled GRUNT. 
HOMER 
Hey, what’s up? 
JASPER 
Some fool kid fell down a well. 
Bart’s face lights up. 
BART 
(TO HIMSELF) Yes! 
EXT. WELL - A LITTLE LATER 
A CROWD, including POLICE, Principal Skinner and reporter 
DAVE SHUTTON, has gathered. One officer drops an apple down 


the well. Police cars and an ambulance are parked nearby. 
Bart hides in the bushes. 


20. 


8F11 FINAL DELIVERY 6/28/91 


BART (V.0O.) 

My name is Timmy O’Toole. I just turned 
ten years old. 

SHUTTON 
Timmy, where are your parents? 

BART (V.0.) 
Uh... I have no family. I tried to 
enroll in school, but your Principal 
Skinner turned me away because of my 
shabby clothes. 

SKINNER 
He’s a liar! 

BART (V.0.) 
Principal Skinner spit on me! He 
kicked my dog! 

CROWD 
(TO SKINNER) Booooooo! 


The CROWD advances menacingly on Skinner. PAN OVER to KENT 
BROCKMAN doing a remote. 


KENT BROCKMAN 
The circumference of the well is 
thirty-four inches. So, unfortunately, 
not one member of our city’s police 
force is slender enough to rescue the 
boy. 


PAN OVER to Police Chief Wiggum addressing a group of 
overweight POLICE OFFICERS. 


8F11 FINAL DELIVERY 6/28/91 


WIGGUM 
By God, men -- you’re a bunch of 
marshmallows! 
The cops, who are eating donuts, hang their heads in shame. 
FAT COP 
Why don’t you go, Chief? 
WIGGUM 
(EMBARRASSED) I’m too... important. 
BACK TO BROCKMAN 
KENT BROCKMAN 
Although the well is too dark to see 
the boy, Timmy has told us his foot is 
trapped under a rock. Thus, any 
attempt to pull him up would snap him 
like a twig. 
Kent SNAPS a twig for emphasis. 
KENT BROCKMAN (CONT’D) 
In desperation, the mayor is 
considering more unorthodox solutions. 
MONTAGE 


We see QUICK CUTS of the following people explaining their 
plans to the mayor. 


1) The man holds up a falcon on his gloved hand. 
FALCON MAN 
Grasping the child firmly in his 
talons, Socrates here will fly him to 


safety! Just watch! 


22. 


8F11 FINAL DELIVERY 6/28/91 


Falcon Man releases a leather strap, letting the falcon fly 
free into the night. He waits a beat. Nothing. 


FALCON MAN (CONT’D) 
I don’t think he’s coming back. 


2) PROFESSOR FRINK stands by a frosted tank with a hose. 
He SPRAYS liquid nitrogen into a model of the well. 


PROFESSOR FRINK 
And the liquid nitrogen will freeze the 
boy so that future generations can 
rescue hin. 


3) A ROBERT SHAW-TYPE SAILOR holds a fish hook and candy 
bar. 


SAILOR 
With this hook, and this hunk of 
chocolate, I’11 land your boy. And 
I’1l clean him for free. 
4) An elaborate circus wagon PULLS UP, playing CALLIOPE 
MUSIC. The DAPPER PROFESSOR steps out, doffs his top hat 
and bows deeply. 
PROFESSOR BEAUREGARD 
(SOUTHERN VOICE) Professor Cornelius 
Vv. Beauregard, Rainmaker to the Crowned 
Heads of Europe, at your service! 
WIGGUM 
Rainmaker? 
QUIMBY 
But, wouldn’t rain drown the boy? 
PROFESSOR BEAUREGARD

And finally, Channel Six’s own Krusty 
the Clown has gathered members of the 
entertainment community -- who normally 
steer clear of fashionable causes -- 
for a video called "We’re Sending Our 
Love Down The Well." 
The video, shot at the recording studio, shows a collection 
of SPRINGFIELD CELEBRITIES, including STEPHANIE THE WEATHER 
LADY, SCOTT CHRISTIAN, BLEEDING CUMS MURPHY, TROY MCCLURE, 
PRINCESS KASHMIR, MAYOR DIAMOND JOE QUIMBY, CAPTAIN LANCE 
MURDOCK, and THE CAPITAL CITY GOOFBALL. They sway back and 
forth with arms over each other’s shoulders as they sing: 
CHOIR 
(SINGING) We’re sending our love down 
the well! We/’re sending our love down 
the well! 
The CLIP CUTS AWAY to an interview with Krusty. 
KRUSTY 
I wanted to do something to help that 
boy. So I called my good friend Sting. 
He said, "Krusty, when do you need me?" 
I said Thursday -- he said, "I’m busy 
Thursday" -- I said, "What about 
Friday?" He said, "Friday’s worse than 
Thursday." Then he said, "How about 
Saturday?" I said, "Fine." (BEAT)

STING 
I used to open for Krusty in ’69. In 
fact, he fired me as I recall. 
KRUSTY 
(LAUGHS WEAKLY) 
STING 
But this isn’t about show business. 
This is about some kid down a hole, or, 
oer something, and we’ve all got to do 
what we can. 
In a clip we see Sting sing. 
STING (CONT’D) 
(SINGING) There’s a hole in my heart / 
As deep as a well / For that poor 
little boy / Who’s stuck half-way to 
hell. 
Sideshow Mel sings with a Jim Nabors-like voice. 
MEL

Krusty, what are your plans for the

Mayor Quimby CLAPS his hand heavily on Skinner’s shoulder 
and points to a chair. He jerks his head at a MOTORCYCLE 
PATROLMAN. 
QUIMBY 


Get our fine Principal a book. 


The patrolman roars off, SIREN wailing. Bart re-joins the

any more tonight.

TITLE CARD: "CAT SPLAT FEVER" 

SCRATCHY walks into his and ITCHY’S bedroom. On the bed 
labeled "Itchy" he finds a note reading "Goodbye, cruel 
world". Out the window, Scratchy sees Itchy jump down a 
well in the back yard. He reacts in horror, runs out the 
door, and jumps down the well. As he falls, Itchy, standing 
on an outcropping of the wall, waves to him. Scratchy 
frantically tries to stop his fall, but lands in the jaws 
of an alligator, who CHEWS him lustily. Scratchy’s HARP- 
PLAYING CAT ANGEL floats up to the top of the well. Itchy 
SHOOTS HIM once, execution style. The angel FALLS to the 
bottom of the well. The end. 


A title card appears, reading "Dedicated to Timmy O’Toole" 
beneath a yellow ribbon.

after him. A second later, on TV, a title card appears 
reading "We’ll Be Back," with Itchy embedding an axe in 
Scratchy’s back. 


The TV cuts away to Kent Brockman and MARVIN MONROE sitting

Bart SWITCHES OFF the microphone and hides it behind his 
back. Lisa points an accusing finger. 


LISA 
Bart Simpson! People are going to want 
your head on a pole when they find out 
you’ve been toying with their

BART 
The police. (SNORTS) They couldn’t 
catch a cold. 
LISA 
Maybe not, but I bet you’re stupid 
enough to have left a "Property of Bart 
Simpson" label on that radio. 
Bart’s eyes pop and his jaw drops. WHIP PAN out the window, 
down the street and down the well to the radio. There is a 
“Property of Bart Simpson" sticker on the back. WHIP PAN 
back to Bart. He SLAPS his forehead.

They CHUCKLE and break the police tape as they exit. Bart 
sneaks in from the bushes. He ties a rope on a tree stump

It operates kind of like a corkscrew.

Well, I’m afraid we’ve got a budget

a bad time to fall down a well. Had he

HOMER steps out from behind the curtain. 
HOMER 

Hello. I’ve been asked to tell you 
that the following show is very 
scary, with stuff that might give 
your kids nightmares. "So what’s the 
problem?" you may ask. Well, there 
are some cry-babies out there -- 
religious types mostly -- who might 
be offended. If you are one of then, 
I advise you to turn off your set 
now. 


A scary looking ZOMBIE with an ax embedded in his head 
staggers out from behind the curtains. 


ZOMBIE 

(LOW, SCARY VOICE) Am I on yet? 
HOMER 

(MOCKING ZOMBIE VOICE) No, you‘re not 


on yet.

Homer tries to find the opening to the curtain, but can’t. 
He and the zombie flail around, GROWLING.

A kids’ Halloween party is in progress. Homer comes down

You children may not know it, but 
there was once an evil witch, and she 
died a horrible death. 

MARTIN 
How? 

MARGE 
(WINGING IT) Well... she had this 
thing on her hand. Didn’t think it 
was much. By the time she went to 
her doctor, it was too late.

Marge passes a raw piece of meat down the line. After a 
BEAT: 


BART (V.0.) 
Yo Mom, we haven’t got the eye balls

Marge CLICKS on the lights. Homer is in the middle of the 
line with spaghetti hanging out of his mouth, about to bite 
the meat. 
MARGE 
Homer, you’re ruining it. 
HOMER 
(COVERING) Yeah... well... it was an 
evil game.

The store is filled with strange bric-a-brac. Homer 
approaches the SHOPKEEPER, an old Keye Luke type in an 
ornately embroidered silk robe. 
HOMER 
Do you sell toys? 
SHOPKEEPER 
(OMINOUS) We sell forbidden objects 
from places men fear to tread.

head labeled "20% rayon, 80% shrunken head"; a stuffed, 
two-headed cat; a beating heart in a jar; and a 16-inch 
Krusty the Clown doll. He brings down the doll. 
HOMER 
(EXAMINING DOLL) I don’t know. It’s 
kinda creepy lookin’. Lemme see the 
beating heart in the jar. 
The shopkeeper hands the jar to Homer. 
SHOPKEEPER 
This heart will provide the owner 
with eternal life. All for only 
$9.95! 
HOMER 
Ten bucks for a heart? Go to hell. 
SHOPKEEPER 
(OFFENDED) Take the doll with ny 
compliments. May it bring you years 
of misery and pain.

There is a party going on. Bart’s friends look on as a 
blindfolded little boy is trying to pin the tail ona 
picture of a donkey which is taped to the front door. Just

the boy over. 
HOMER

Bart unwraps the gift, and pulls out the doll. The crowd 
"Oohs.""

The "Occult" section is lit by a skull with a candle in it. 
Bart brushes aside some cobwebs and walks in. A faint 
HEARTBEAT can be heard, along with scattered DISTANT WAILS. 
A rat scurries back into his hole. Bart scans the titles; 
the Dewey decimal numbers are all 666. 


A book behind him wriggles its way out of the stack and 
HITS Bart in the back of the head.

ACT ONE 
FADE IN: 
INT. MRS. KRABAPPEL'S CLASSROOM - MORNING 


BART is fooling around with the paper cutter. The blade is 
poised over a milk carton from SHERRI'S lunch. 


BART 
I sentence this milk carton to DEATH! 
We SEE Bart has already sliced several items, including a 
math book, a gym shoe, and a world globe. Bart brings down 
the blade and slices the carton in half, squirting milk 
over everything including himself. MRS. KRABAPPEL grabs 
his hand. 
MRS. KRABAPPEL 
BART! The paper cutter is not a 
plaything. 
BART 
(GROUSING) Aw, geez. The turtle's not 
a plaything, the flag's not a 
plaything... 
MRS. KRABAPPEL 
Quiet. Now, class, I promised you a 


surprise today... 


We SEE quick cuts of excited KIDS imagining what the 
surprise might be: 


MILHOUSE 


Wow (picturing in his mind) 


8F15 FINAL DELIVERY 68/2/91 2. 


A.) An INDIAN wrestling a giant alligator. 
SHERRI 
(SIGHS) (picturing in her mind) 
B.) Happy TROLLS handing out ice cream. 
BART 
I knew it. (picturing in his mind) 


Cc.) Mrs. Krabappel pulling off her face, revealing she is a 
moon man. 


MRS. KRABAPPEL 
.-.And here it is. We're going to take 
a test. 
BART 
(MOANS) 
INT. MISS HOOVER'S CLASSROOM - CONTINUOUS 
MISS HOOVER 
We're going to take a test. 
LISA 
All right! A test! 


The other KIDS stare at LISA. She looks embarrassed. MISS 
HOOVER starts handing out the computer sheets to everyone. 


MISS HOOVER 
It's called the Career Aptitude 


Normalizing Test, or "CANT". 


INT. 


MRS. 


8F15 FINAL DELIVERY 8/2/91 3. 


KRABAPPEL'S CLASSROOM - CONTINUOUS 

MRS. KRABAPPEL 
Some of you may discover a wonderful 
vocation you never even imagined. 
Others may find out life isn't fair. 
(BITTERLY) In spite of your Masters 
fron Bryn-mawr, you might end up a 
glorified baby-sitter to a bunch of 
dead-eyed fourth graders while your 
husband runs naked on a beach with your 
marriage counselor. 

BART 
The test be damned. Let's explore your 
pain. 

MRS. KRABAPPEL 
(COMPOSING HERSELF) First question: 
(READS) "If I could be any animal, I 
would be A) A Carpenter Ant; B) A Nurse 


Shark; or C) A Lawyer Bird." 


The students fill in their answer sheets. Bart makes a 
sloppy mark in one of the fill-in bars. 


INT. MISS HOOVER'S CLASSROOM = LATER 


MISS HOOVER 
Question sixty: (READS) I prefer the 
smell of A) Gasoline; B) French Fries; 


er C) Bank Customers." 


The children complete their tests. 


8F15 FINAL DELIVERY 8/2/91 4. 


JANEY 
(TO LISA) Well, that was a waste of 
time. 
LISA 
Janey, school is never a waste of time. 
MISS HOOVER 
Since we have fifteen minutes until 
recess, please put down your pencils 
and stare at the front of the roon. 
AN HOUR LATER 
Miss Hoover hands a bundle of answer sheets to a UNIFORMED 
COURIER. He puts them in a pouch, spins the combination 
lock and rushes out the door. 
EXT. IOWA NON-INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - DAY 
A sleek jet has barely rolled to a stop when its cargo 
hatch opens. A HANDLER transfers a mailbag marked 
"STANDARDIZED TESTS" into a waiting truck, which Z00MS off. 
It passes a sign reading: " WELCOME TO IOWA - THE TESTING 
STATE." 
EXT. NATIONAL TESTING CENTER - PROCTORVILLE, IOWA 
We follow the delivery truck through a grand, intimidating 
entrance gate, shaped like a bell curve. It reads: 
"National Testing Center. Controlling Your Destiny Since 
1925." 
INT. NATIONAL TESTING CENTER 
A bored WORKER dumps the answer sheets into a big hopper, 
which sorts them onto a conveyor belt. We follow them 
along the conveyor belt to an ancient-looking computer 


labeled "ELECTRONIC BRAIN". It emits puffs of steam fron 
time to time. 


8F15 FINAL DELIVERY 8/2/91 5. 


CLOSE-UP 
We SEE Lisa's answer sheet go in. The computer "thinks" 
for a second, with BLINKING LIGHTS and a CHUGGING NOISE, 
then SPITS out a printout card. We SEE Bart's answer sheet 
go in. The computer thinks and thinks, then GRINDS to a 
halt. A wiry old ATTENDANT in a rocking chair, with a 
BALLGAME PLAYING on the radio, spots the bottleneck. 
ATTENDANT 

C'mon Emma. 
Without getting up, he BANGS on the balky computer with a 
broom handle. It starts chugging again, and SPITS out an 
answer. 
INT. SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGIST'S OFFICE = DAY 
SUPER: EIGHT WEEKS LATER 


We see QUICK SHOTS of the kids reading their results in DR. 
J. LOREN PRYOR's office.

Awriigght! 

LISA 
Homemaker? ! 

DR. PRYOR 


Hmmm. It's like a Mommy. 


BART 
(SURPRISED) Police officer? Well, I'll 
be jiggered. 

DR. PRYOR 
(CHUCKLING) If you'd like to learn 
more I could arrange for you to ride 
along in a police car for a night. 

BART 
Hey, I don't need you to get me in the 


back of a police car. 


8F15 FINAL DELIVERY 8/2/91 7. 


DR. PRYOR 
I really think you should consider 
this. You know, before I saw these 
test results I had you pegged as a 
drifter. 
BART 
Wow, a drifter. 
Bart imagines what this would be like. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. DREAM CLOUD 


We see an ADULT BART shabbily dressed hitchhiking on a 
dusty road. 


ADULT BART 
Stupid President, took my job... all 
against me... big conspiracy... 
A car ZOOMS past him kicking up dust. 
ADULT BART (CONT'D) 
(MUTTERING) All right, you're on ny 


list. 


BACK TO SCENE 
BART 
Cool. 
Bart stares dreamily. 
DR. PRYOR 


Bart?... Bart? 


8F15 FINAL DELIVERY 8/2/91 8. 


INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - DINING ROOM - THAT NIGHT 
The family is eating dinner. Lisa is upset. 
LISA 
A homemaker! I might as well be dead! 
MARGE 
(A LITTLE HURT) Lisa, it's not that 
bad. 
HOMER 
(MOUTH FULL) So what're you gonna be, 
boy? 
BART 
(UNHAPPILY) Policeman. 
HOMER 
(SNORTS, CHOKES) 
MARGE 
(PROUDLY) That's nice, Bart. You know 
your father wanted to be a policeman 
for a little while. But they said he 
was too heavy. 
HOMER 
No, the Army said I was too heavy. The 


police said I was too dumb. 


8F15 FINAL DELIVERY 8/2/91 


LISA 
Well, I'm going to be a famous jazz 
musician. I've got it all figured out. 
I'll be unappreciated in my own 
country, but my gutsy blues stylings 
will electrify the French. I'll avoid 
the horrors of drug abuse, but I do 
plan to have several torrid love 
affairs. And I may or may not die 
young, I haven't decided. 
MARGE 
Honey, if that's what you want, we'll 
do anything we can to help. 
LISA 
Well, you could give me private 
lessons. 
MARGE 
All right. 
HOMER 
Wait a minute. Isn't anybody going to 
follow in my footsteps? 
SILENCE, followed by QUIET CREAKS of the house settling. 
INT. LI'L LUDWIG'S MUSIC STUDIO - NEXT DAY 
We see a caricature of the familiar Beethoven's head on a 
baby body wearing a diaper and holding a conductor's baton. 


There are big musical notes on the wall and busts of 
composers. A goateed MUSIC TEACHER greets Lisa and MARGE. 


8F15 FINAL DELIVERY 8/2/91 


LISA 

Can you tell me if I have what it takes 

to be a blues musician? 
FORTE 

Sure can. Show me your chops. 

Lisa PLAYS a short, fairly simple piece on her saxophone. 

FORTE (CONT'D) 

(LISTENING) Uh huh... Uh huh. 


He smiles pleasantly and taps his foot to the music. She 
finishes with an expectant look. 


FORTE (CONT'D) 
Cool. 
MARGE 
Hmmm. So you think she has talent? 
FORTE 
Sure. 
MARGE 
Do you think she could be a 
professional some day? 
FORTE 
Oh, Lord no. 
LISA 


(SHOCKED) But I'll practice every day! 


10. 


8F15 FINAL DELIVERY 


FORTE 


I'll be frank with you, Lisa. And when 


I say frank, I mean, you know, 
devastating. (HOLDING UP LISA'S HAND) 
You've inherited a finger condition 
known as "stubbiness". It usually 


comes from the father's side. 


cuT TO: 


INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM 
HOMER struggles, MUTTERING, to keep his grip on 
beer, but his stubby fingers slip off. The can 
the floor and spills. 
HOMER 
Stupid fingers. 
BACK TO SCENE 
LISA 


(UPSET) You're wrong, you're wrong! 


a can of 
falls on 


You don't need long fingers to play the 


blues. The blues come from in here! 


Lisa points to her heart, then notices her fingers. 


LISA (CONT'D) 
My God, they are stubby. 
MARGE 
Oh, honey... 
FORTE 
(SYMPATHETIC) Hey, I'm very sorry. 
(LOOKS AT WATCH) But now, you'll have 


to excuse me... I gotta lesson. 


8/2/91 


11. 


8F15 FINAL DELIVERY 8/2/91 


A TINY BLACK GIRL of about four with sunglasses like Ray 
Charles' enters with her MOTHER. She needs to stand on a 
telephone book to reach the mouthpiece of her saxophone. 
She PLAYS a very difficult solo with fluid grace. 
FORTE (CONT'D) 

(UNIMPRESSED) Come on, now, Coral. 

Quit messing around. 
The girl continues to play. Lisa looks devastated. 
EXT. SIMPSON HOUSE - FRONT PORCH 


Officers EDDIE and LOU are picking up Bart for the ride- 
along. Bart points at Lou's belt. 


BART 
Wow! Can I see your club? 
LOU 
It's called a baton, son. 
BART 
Oh, what's it for? 
Lou 
We club people with it. 
INT. WINFIELD RESIDENCE 
Through her curtains, MRS. WINFIELD sees the cop car parked 
in front of the Simpsons' house. The cops help Bart into 
the back seat. 
MRS. WINFIELD 
Well, it's about time. 
INT. SQUAD CAR - NIGHT 
Bart rides in the back seat as the cops cruise the streets. 


BART 


So, you guys like being cops? 


12s. 


8F15 FINAL DELIVERY 8/2/91 13. 


LOU 
Oh it's great. You get to run red 
lights... Park wherever you please... 
Hot and cold running chicks... 

EDDIE 
And when you go home at night, you know 
you've made a difference. 

LOU 
Hey Bart, you see that Caddy over 
there? 

BART 
Huh-huh. 


A car has a vanity plate: I RULE U. It's parked at the 
"Who's To Know" Motel. The logo is a winking owl. 


LOU (CONT'D) 
That's Mayor Quimby's car. Tonight 
Hizzoner is “polling the electorate". 
INT. "WHO'S TO KNOW" MOTEL - CONTINUOUS 
We see QUIMBY drinking champagne with an attractive WOMAN. 
QUIMBY 
How would you like a street named after 
you? 
BACK TO SCENE 
BART 
(LOW ADMIRING WHISTLE) 


They pass SIDESHOW MEL rollerblading along with his Afghan 
hound. 


8F15 FINAL DELIVERY 8/2/91 


EDDIE 
(SHAKING HEAD) I tell ya, they only 
come out at night. 
INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - LISA'S ROOM - LATER 
Lisa is sadly writing in her diary. 
LISA 
(WRITING) Dear Log... This will be my 
last entry. For you were a journal of 
my hopes and dreams, and now I have 
none. 
INT. POLICE CAR - NIGHT 
Bart and the cops are stopped at a red light. In the B.G. 
is the QUIK-E-MART: the JAILBIRD from "The War of the 
Simpsons" points a shotgun at APU. Apu raises his hands. 
The light changes. We stay with the squad car as it drives 
off, oblivious. 
BART 
Do you need straight A's to be a cop? 
Eddie and Lou bust out LAUGHING. 
BART (CONT'D) 
Hey, fellas, let's go shoot some bad 
guys. 
Lou 
(CHUCKLES) Well, it doesn't quite work 
that way, son. 
EDDIE 
People see movies like "McBain" and 
they think it's all bang-bang, shoot- 


em-up, cops-n-robbers. 


14. 


8F15 FINAL DELIVERY 8/2/91 15. 


Just then a muscle car ZOOMS by. 
EDDIE (CONT'D) 
Let's roll! 
INT. POLICE CAR - NIGHT 
The cops take off in pursuit, SIREN WAILING. 
EDDIE 
(INTO MIKE) One ocean tango... We are 
in pursuit of a speeding individual, 
driving a red... (SQUINTS) ...car. 
License number... (SQUINTS) 
EDDIE'S POV 
The license plate reads: "EX CON". 
EDDIE (V.0O.) 
Eggplgnt-Xerxes-Crybaby-Overbite- 
Narwhal. 
INT. FLEEING CAR 
The Jailbird is driving. On the seat beside him is an open 
cash register with money in it. Next to it is a box 
labelled "Lottery Tickets". 
JAILBIRD 
Ohhh, nooo. Coppppss. 
He floors the surfer-foot gas pedal. 
SMASH CUT TO: 
INT. KWIK-E-MART - CONTINUOUS 


Apu is tied up to a chair behind the counter. 


8F15 FINAL DELIVERY 8/2/91 16. 


APU 
(PLEASED, TO SELF) Ooh, they used nylon 
rope this time. It feels so smooth 
against my skin. Almost sensuous. 
EXT. STREET 
A high speed chase ensues, scored with thrilling STARSKY 
AND HUTCH-STYLE MUSIC. The two cars fly over a ravine and 
SQUEAL around corners on two wheels. They fly over several 
San Francisco-type hills. Bart, wearing a lap seatbelt, 
bounces around in the back seat. 
BART 
Oh, BABY! 
Another car, SWERVING to avoid the chase, PLOWS INTO the 
side of a tanker truck labelled "MILK". The milk truck 
EXPLODES in a huge fireball. 
EXT. WAREHOUSE DISTRICT 
The chase continues past some loading docks. In true cop- 
show fashion, the cars keep CRASHING through piles of empty 
cardboard boxes. 
EDDIE 
Damn boxes! 
Finally, the jailbird swerves into an -- 
EXT. OUTDOOR PARKING LOT 


And turns off his engine. The cops block the entrance with 
their car. 


EDDIE 
He's trapped. 


Tension runs high as the cops get out of the car. They 
glance around uneasily. 


Lou 


Where's our backup? 


8F15 FINAL DELIVERY 8/2/91 


EDDIE 
(AGITATED) I don't know. Son, this is 
against every regulation, but would you 
cover us? 
He hands Bart a .38. 
BART 
Woww! 
Warily, they leave to look for the convict. 
NEAR THE ENTRANCE 


Suddenly, the jailbird's car ROARS to life, surprisingly 
near, and PEELS OUT, heading straight for Bart. 


JAILBIRD 
(LAUGHING) See ya in hell, punk. 

A terrified Bart starts FIRING desperately at the car, 
missing every time and hitting the dirt, a flower pot, 
everything else, until he runs out of ammo. The gun 
CLICKS. Bart is trapped in the alley. There is nowhere to 
run. He barely has a chance to SCREAM, as the car hurtles 
toward him at top speed. It's an inch from hitting him 
when we -- 
FREEZE FRAME 
On Bart's frightened face looking over the hood of the car. 
SUPER: TO BE CONTINUED! 

FADE OUT. 


END OF ACT ONE 


17. 


8F15 FINAL DELIVERY 8/2/91 


ACT _TWO 
FADE IN: 
EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT 
We again see the car bearing down on Bart. However, the 
alley is much narrower than it was before the act break, 
and the car GRINDS to a halt with a loud CRUNCH. The 
jailbird BANGS his head on the wheel. 
JAILBIRD 
(PAINED GROAN) 
A millimeter from certain death, Bart slowly opens his 
eyes. Eddie and Lou run over to the car and hold guns on 
the jailbird. 
EDDIE 
Man, that was close! 
LOU 
Good thing this alley got so narrow in 


the middle. 


Several squad cars SCREECH UP. CHIEF WIGGUM hops out of 
one. 


WIGGUM 
(TO EDDIE AND LOU) That's nice work, 
boys. 


Wiggum takes the stolen lottery tickets out of the 
Jailbird's car. 


WIGGUM (CONT'D) 
(TO JAILBIRD) Looks like you just 
bought yourself a lottery ticket... to 
jail. 
LOU 


He's unconscious, sir. 


18. 


8F15 FINAL DELIVERY 8/2/91 19. 


WIGGUM 
(COVERING) They can still hear things! 
BART 
(TO WIGGUM) Sir, I know what I wanna 
be when I grow up. (PROUDLY) A cop! 
WIGGUM 
Well, until then, son, I'm gonna make 
you an honorary police officer... 
Eddie, give him your badge. 
EDDIE 
Hey! 
INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING 


Marge is preparing a big breakfast. Lisa enters, looking 
sullen. 


MARGE 
Morning, honey. 

LISA 
(MUMBLES SOURLY) 

MARGE 
Lisa, I know you're down on homemaking, 
but it can really let you be creative. 
See, this morning I turned bacon, eggs 
and toast into a nice smiley face for 
Bart and Homer. 

Marge displays two plates. The eggs are the eyes, bacon 


the mouth, and the toast, sliced diagonally, forms the 
ears. 


8F15 FINAL DELIVERY 8/2/91 20. 


LISA 
What's the point? They'll never 
notice. 
MARGE 
Oh well, you'd be surprised. 
Marge takes two plates to the table. No sooner do they hit 
the table than Homer and Bart immediately wolf down the 
food without looking at it. 
SFX: CHOMPING NOISES 
Lisa looks up at an embarrassed Marge. 
MARGE (CONT'D) 
(MURMURS ) 
INT. SPRINGFIELD ELEMENTARY - BAND ROOM - AFTERNOON 


MR. LARGO is leading the band through a shaky version of a 
SOUSA MARCH. 


LARGO 
All right, people. C'mon now, big 
finish! 


Lisa enters as the SONG FINISHES with a Portsmouth 
Symphonia WHEEZE. 


LARGO (CONT'D) 
(SIGHS) Okay. (TURNS TO LISA) 
Simpson, where's your saxophone? 
LISA 
I gave it away. 
EXT. SPRINGFIELD ELEMENTARY - DAY 
oTTo is standing in front of the schoolbus with the hood 


open. He has the mouthpiece stuck in the engine and pours 
oil in the big end. 


8F15 FINAL DELIVERY 8/2/91 21. 


oTTo 
Gnarly funnel, man. 
INT. SPRINGFIELD ELEMENTARY - BAND ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
LISA 
Mr. Largo, I'll never play the 
saxophone again. 
LARGO 
Oh, Lisa, I beg you to reconsider. 
LISA 
(BRIGHTENING) You think I'm that good? 
LARGO 
Well, no. But you really knew how to 
peddle the band candy. 
INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON 


Bart, wearing his police badge, is playing with a toy 
fingerprint kit. 


BART 
Now, just relax your hand. 


Bart presses Maggie's hand to an ink pad, then gets her 
handprint on a fingerprint card. 


BART (CONT'D) 
Thank you, Ma'am. You've been most 
cooperative. 
Maggie crawls off, leaving a cute trail of handprints. 
INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - KITCHEN 


Marge stands in front of a chocolate cake that has been 
viciously mauled. Marge glowers at SANTA'S LITTLE HELPER. 


MARGE 


Bad dog! Very bad dog. 


8F15 FINAL DELIVERY 8/2/91 22. 


Bart enters wearing his badge. 
BART 
Mom, before you blame the dog, I think 
you should take a look at these 
surveillance photos. 
Bart hands Marge a series of black and white photos that 
show Homer violently devouring the cake on all fours like a 
dog. Marge comes across a photo of Bart taking a picture 
of his butt in the mirror. 
MARGE 
Oh... Oh... Oh, Bart. 
BART 
Uh, I don't know how that got in there. 
INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - LISA'S ROOM - NIGHT 


Lisa is sprawled on the carpet, reading comic books and 
eating junk food. Marge looks in. 


MARGE 
(WORRIED) I got a note from school 
today. Did you really drop out of the 
band? 

LISA 
(NOT LOOKING UP) Yup. 

MARGE 
Uh, honey, right now you're 
discouraged. But deep down, you know 
you love the saxophone. I think you 


should stay in the band. 


8F15 FINAL DELIVERY 8/2/91 23. 


LISA 
(SARCASTIC) If you think it's so 
great, why don't you join the band? 
MARGE 
Lisa, there are a lot of people in the 
world who like to tell you what you 
can't do. But they don't always know 
what they're talking about. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. BOUVIER HOUSE = MARGE'S GIRLHOOD BEDROOM - 1965 
A YOUNG MARGE has built a makeshift Gemini spaceship out of 
a cardboard box. She has an oatmeal box on her head with a 
space cut out for her face. A Gemini rocket poster is on 
the wall. A YOUNG PATTY and a YOUNG SELMA enter. 
YOUNG MARGE 
You know what I want to be when I grow 
up? 
YOUNG PATTY 
The girl on the oatmeal box? 
Patty and Selma CHUCKLE. 
YOUNG MARGE 
No, I'm going to be an astronaut. 
YOUNG SELMA 
Women can't be astronauts. 


YOUNG MARGE 


Why not? 


8F15 FINAL DELIVERY 8/2/91 24. 


YOUNG PATTY 
They'd distract the men astronauts so 
they wouldn't keep their minds on the 
road. 
YOUNG MARGE 
There will too be women astronauts! 
Patty and Selma CHUCKLE. 
YOUNG MARGE (CONT'D) 
It's true! And we'll all live in 
cities on the moon. 
DISSOLVE BACK: 
INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - LISA'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS 
MARGE 
So you see, my sisters were wrong. 
(FLUSTERED) Except about the cities on 
the moon. I was wrong about that. 
So... well, you can see how anyone can 
be wrong. 
LISA 
(DISCONTENTED MURMUR) 
INT. SPRINGFIELD ELEMENTARY - HALLWAY - A LITTLE LATER 
A discouraged Lisa walks past the school mascot, a life- 
size statue of a puma. Above it is a sign: "PUMA PRIDE -- 
wow!!" She rolls her eyes. Her pal JANEY joins her. 
JANEY 


Hi Lis, want to quiz me on the vowels? 


8F15 FINAL DELIVERY 8/2/91 25. 


LISA 
Janey, I'm about ready to chuck the 
whole stinking alphabet. 
JANEY 
Huh? 
Lisa stops by the door to a girls' bathroom. We hear 
trashy ROCK MUSIC. Someone has scrawled "STAY THE HELL 
OUT" on it. Lisa opens the door a crack -- smoke drifts 
out. 
JANEY (CONT'D) 
(ALARMED) Lisa, what are you doing? 
That's the bad girl bathroom. 
LISA 
(SARCASTIC) A doy. 
Lisa goes in. 
INT. SPRINGFIELD ELEMENTARY = TOUGH GIRLS' BATHROOM = CONT. 
Inside are a couple of tough fifth graders, DONNA and 
TAMMY. They perch on the sinks, smoking and reading 
Cosmopolitan. Several cartons of eggs are nearby. 
DONNA 
You wanna egg Skinner's car? 
‘TAMMY 
Nah, he put a special coating on it. 
The eggs just bead up and slide right

Oh. (THEN) Wanna egg his house?

Okay.

DONNA

LISA 
(SCARED) Nothing. 
TAMMY 
Then get out, 'cause we're figuring out 
stuff to egg. 
They start to shove Lisa toward the door. 
LISA 
Okay, but if you really want to honk 
Skinner off, I suggest you attack the 
one thing he truly believes in. 
Intrigued, the girls stop shoving Lisa. 
SMASH CUT TQ: 
INT. SPRINGFIELD ELEMENTARY - HALLWAY - NEXT MORNING 
The school puma has been vandalized with eggs, toilet 
paper, multi-colored silly string, etc. It looks like a 
woolly mammoth. Skinner shakes his head sadly. 
SKINNER 
I saw some awful things in 'Nam, but 
you really have to wonder at the 
mentality that would desecrate a 
helpless puma. (FRUSTRATED) I never 
thought I'd say this, but the no- 
goodniks rule this school! 


From outside, we hear Groundskeeper Willy's MUFFLED CRIES.

Eddie and Lou are struggling to cuff an irate GROUNDSKEEPER 
WILLY. 


WILLY 
Think you're big men with your

BART 
(DISMISSIVE HEAD GESTURE) Get him 
outta here. 
The cops hustle Willy away. 
WILLY 
I'll get you Bart Simpson, if it's the 
last thing I do! 
Skinner enters. 
SKINNER 
(EXASPERATED) Now what is this all 
about? 
BART 
Well, it's quite simple, really. I 
observed our friend Groundskeeper Willy 
burning leaves with a blatant disregard 


for our clean air laws. 


8F15 FINAL DELIVERY 8/2/91 28. 


SKINNER 
Has the world gone topsy-turvy? Bart 
Simpson on the side of law and order? 
BART 
That's right, man. I got my first 
taste of authority... (RELISHING) And 
I liked it. 
Skinner thoughtfully puts his hand to his chin. 
INT. SPRINGFIELD ELEMENTARY = SKINNER'S OFFICE - LATER 
SKINNER 
Bart, there are a lot of troublemakers 
in this school... and Lord knows I 
can't be everywhere at once. 
BART 
Go on. 
SKINNER 
Look, let's can the euphemisms. No 
more bullspit. How would you like to 
be a hall monitor? 
BART 
Wouldn't that mean squealing on other 
kids? 
SKINNER 
That's the meat of it, yes.

BART'S FANTASY:

Now, Witness X, will you please tell 
the court what you saw? 


Bart is on the witness stand, wearing a black disguise hood 
that conforms a little too well to his spiky head. 


SUPER: "VOICE DISGUISED TO SOUND LIRE STEVE ALLEN" 
STEVE ALLEN VOICE 
I'd be more than happy to. I saw Mr. 
Montone there (POINTS HIM OUT) seal the 
late Mr. Palacio in an oil drum and 
roll him off the pier. 


Suddenly MR. MONTONE breaks free from the defense table and 
lunges for Bart. 


MR. MONTONE 
I keel you!! 
He stabs Bart again and again. 
STEVE ALLEN VOICE 
Aye carumba! 
BACK TO SCENE 
BART 
It's tempting... but I don't know. 
SKINNER

BART 
(CALLING TO PASSING KIDS) .Hey, Jimbo, 
keepin' your nose clean, dude? 
Attaboy! Hey, Donna, who loves ya,

Behind Bart a KID ZO00MS by on a skateboard. Without 
looking, Bart sticks his leg out and stops the skateboard 
with his foot. The kid goes flying. Bart smoothly flips 
the skateboard up with his foot and sticks it under his 
arn. 
BART (CONT'D) 
(TO KID) Not in my hall, bub. 


B) Bart passes a drinking fountain with a line of KIDS 
behind it. A LITTLE GIRL is drinking a lot of water. 


BART (CONT'D) 
I think you've had enough, sister. 
c''mon, let's keep it moving. 


Bart ushers her along. The next KID steps up and starts to 
take a drink. 


Cc) A CROWD of children has gathered in the hall. In the

Allright, break it up, boys. That

KEARNY 
Okay. (BEAT) Wedgie! 
Kearny abruptly pulls Milhouse's underwear up. 
MILHOUSE 
Oh! 
Dolph, Kearny and Jimbo exit, LAUGHING. 
MILHOUSE (CONT'D)

MARGE 
Bart's grades are up a little this

He has white paste around his mouth and a paste applicator

RALPH 
(STICKY MOUTH) No, Miss Hoover.

MISS HOOVER 
Good. Now, sprinkle your sparkles on

A happy Skinner walks down the hallway with Bart. 


8P15 FINAL DELIVERY 8/2/91 


SKINNER 
Bart, you're doing a bang-up job. You 
know, before there were some corridors 
of this school you'd just never go 
down. Now I feel safe anywhere. 
BART 
Every day is a new fight, sir. 
Skinner tousles Bart's hair. 
SKINNER 
(PROUDLY) Bart, the school is a police 
state. Students are afraid to sneeze. 
And I have you to thank. Come with me. 
Skinner unlocks a door labeled "Seized Property Room". 
INT. SPRINGFIELD ELEMENTARY - SEIZED PROPERTY ROOM 
Skinner lets Bart into a storage room enclosed in chain- 
link fencing, like a police evidence room. It's a kid's 
dream -- a treasure trove of contraband goodies. We see 
girly magazines, teacher caricatures, banned t-shirts, 
firecrackers, laff bags, spray paint cans, switchblades, 
nunchuks, etc. Some items are in plastic bags with tags 
that say "EVIDENCE." 
BART 
(AWED) Madre de Dios! The legends 


were true!

Yes Bart, whenever a teacher 
confiscates something it ends up here. 
(POINTS) Salacious halter-tops, 
complete collections of Mad, Cracked 
and the occasional issue of Crazy, and 
this fake plastic derriere. 


Skinner holds up a large plastic butt with two red lip 
prints on the back. 


BART 
(LAUGHS UPROARIOUSLY) 
SKINNER 
Now, to show my gratitude, I want you 
to help yourself to an item of your 
choice. 
BART 
All-riight! 
Skinner winces as Bart selects a crossbow. 
SKINNER 
Ooo, now, you be careful with that 
crossbow. 
BART 
(SINCERE) I will.

In a stylized montage a la "Cotton Club", we see a series

SKINNER 
Busted!

Milhouse blows the wrapper off a straw. It hits Kearney in 
the head. 


KEARNEY 
Ow! Bart, do something. 
BART 
Let's go, Milhouse. 
He drags Milhouse off. 
MILHOUSE 
Sure, we have order. But at what 
price! 
INT. MISS HOOVER'S CLASSROOM - DAY 
Lisa is absently drawing on the desktop.

She sees the teacher's edition Miss Hoover was using 
earlier.

She wouldn't be so smart without her 
(MOCKING) Teacher's edition. 


With an evil gleam, Lisa closes the book and stuffs it in 
her backpack. 


We see QUICK SHOTS of Lisa in other classrooms, swiping 
more teacher's editions, and stashing them in her bookbag. 
Finally she puts a big stack in her locker and SLAMS the

(PICKING UP PHONE) We're going to have

Bart calmly presses the disconnect button on the phone. 
BART

those books are still here. All we 


have to do is search every locker.

Oh, Bart, I'm not sure random locker

Pfft, Supreme Court. What have they

himself. 


INT. SPRINGFIELD ELEMENTARY - HALLWAY - DAY 
Over DRAMATIC MUSIC we see SEVERAL SHOTS of Bart and 
Skinner searching lockers -- shot at various camera angles, 
etc. Bart opens one locker and pulls out big bundles of 
cash. He shrugs and tosses it back in. Skinner opens a 
locker and sees a large stuffed: panda bear. 
SKINNER 
Hmm... 
Skinner RIPS OFF the head and sees nothing.

BART 
Martin! Who did this to you? 
MARTIN 
There were about thirty of 'em. They 
were mad I gave them a pop quiz. 
Bart rolls his eyes and moves on. He opens another locker 
and is stunned to see a stack of teacher's editions. Bart. 
GASPS. He pulls some out. The rest of the textbooks fall 
on the floor, revealing a picture of the Simpsons. 
BART 
(GASPS) Lisa. 
LISA (0.S.) 
That's right. It was I. 
Bart shuts the door revealing Lisa. He is shocked. 
BART 
Lis, why did you do it? 
LISA 
Come on, Bart. In your pre-Fascist 
days, you knew the giddy thrill of 


futile rebellion. 


8F15 FINAL DELIVERY 8/2/91 45. 


BART 
Yeah, but even I had my limits. If 
you're mad, plug up a toilet, organize

expulsion for this. 
LISA 
I know. I know. 
Lisa starts SOBBING. 
CLOSE UP - BART 
He looks at her, worried.

Skinner falls to his knees and runs his fingers through the

SKINNER (CONT'D) 
Oh, answers! Answers! (TO BART) 
Simpson, you just saved the school one

Skinner is there with Bart and Lisa.

BART 
(COCKY) Sorry if I betrayed your trust, 
Principal Sucker. 

SKINNER 
Doh. 

LISA 
(GUILTILY) I can't let you do this, 
Bart. Principal Skinner, I took the 
books. 

SKINNER 
Oh, Lisa, this is the kind of 
selflessness I could expect from you. 
Your brother should take a lesson. 
(SIGHS) (FACING UNPLEASANT TASK) Now 
Bart, in light of your recent service 
to the school, I've decided to be

Oooh, big man.

MILHOUSE 
Let's go, Simpson. 

INT. SPRINGFIELD ELEMENTARY = HALLWAY - A LITTLE LATER 
Milhouse is leading Bart to detention. Lisa follows. 
LISA 
Bart, why did you take the blame? 

BART 

‘Cause I didn't want you to wreck your

talent to go as far as you want, no 
matter what anyone says. And when you 
do, I'll be right there to borrow 
money.

BART 
Soundin' good, Lis!

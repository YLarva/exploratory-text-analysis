TROY MCCLURE 
Hello everybody. I’m Troy McClure, 
star of such films as "P is for 
‘Psycho’" and "The President’s Neck 
Is Missing." But now I’m here to 
tell you about a remarkable new 
invention. 


He picks up an orange and clumsily squeezes it with his 
hand over a glass, making a mess. 


TROY MCCLURE 
Until now, this was the only way to 
get juice from an orange.

But that’s all changed thanks to the 
"Juice Loosener." Let’s meet the 
inventor, Doctor Nick Riviera. 


DR. NICK enters carrying a large boxy juicer labelled "The 
Juice Loosener."

Troy, would you like a glass of 
orange juice? 
TROY MCCLURE 
I sure would. But won’t we have to 
pay those outrageous grocery store 
prices for something the farmer 
probably spit in? 
DR. NICK 
Not anymore. 
Troy drops his jaw and SLAPS his mouth in disbelief. 
DR. NICK (CONT’/D) 
All, thanks to the new "Juice 
Loosener." 


Dr. Nick pours a bag of oranges into the juicer. We hear a 
hideous GRINDING noise. Pulp flies on Troy’s face. 


TROY MCCLURE 
Doctor, are you sure it’s on? I 
can’t hear a thing. 

DR. NICK 
(YELLING) It’s whisper quiet. 


Dr. Nick finishes. There’s a tiny amount of juice on the 
bottom of the glass.

oranges?

Scratchy’s tonsils and ties them to a brick. He tosses the 
brick out a window, pulling Scratchy’s tonsils and inards

So, Mr. Nahasapeemapetilan, if that

forgotten anthing? 
APU 
No, but my brother Sanjay did. But 
he has been shot in the head so many 
times, you must make allowances. 
HUTZ 
So, you never forget anything? Then

tie, his back to Apu. 
HUTZ 
Oh, I am, am I? (STUGGLING WITH TIE) 
Is that what you think? Well, if 
that is what you think, I have 
something to tell you. Something 
that may shock and discredit you. 
And that thing is as follows... 
Huts wheels around, bare necked. 
HUTZ (CONT’D) 
I’m not wearing a tie at all. 
The jury GASPS. 
APU 
(GASPS) But, if I am wrong about 
that, maybe I’m wrong about Mrs.

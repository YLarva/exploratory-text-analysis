LIFE ON THE FAST LANE

PADE IN: 
INT. SIMPSONS! KITCHEN - EARLY MORNING 
A pancake flies up into the frame and flips over. We 
follow it as it drops down, landing on the griddle. WE CUT 
WIDER and see Bart and Lisa busily making a special 
birthday breakfast ,for Marge. Lisa is watching the 
microwave intently. Bart is making pancakes and HUMMING a 
jaunty tune. Enthusiastically he spoons batter onto the 
griddle, dripping batter with every move. He then flips 
the flapjacks with a spatula, sending them into the air and 
missing a few. 
BART 
Whoops! Whoops! Oh whoops...Ewww... 
whoops! 
LISA (V.0.) 
This is going to be the best birthday 
breakfast Mom ever had. 


Bart scoops a pancake from the griddle and puts it on the 
top of a huge stack of pancakes already made. 


BART 
Hey Lis, you think that's enough for 


her?

LISA 
Maybe one more. 
The microwave's BELL sounds. Lisa opens the door and pulls 
out a microwave cake. She starts preparing the frosting 
for mixing. 
LISA 
I hope she likes the presents we got 
her. 
BART 
Well, I know she'll like mine. Who 
wouldn't like a bottle of real French 
perfume? 


Bart reaches under the counter and produces a gallon jug of 
perfume which has a generic label "French Perfume" on it. 


BART (CONT'D) 
All of the way from Gay Paree. Four 
bucks, plus tax. 
LISA 
Well, I think she's gonna like my hand- 
made birthday card better. 
BART 
Big deal... dry macaroni... spray- 
paint, and glue. Whoopee! 
Lisa produces a large macaroni mosaic that is extremely 
elaborate. It's a copy of "Whistler's Mother" with Marge 
in a rocking chair. It says, "I Love You Mom, By Lisa." 
Lisa begins mixing the frosting with an electric mixer. 
BART 
Dibs! First dibs, I get to lick the 


beaters. 


FINAL DELIVERY 10/16/89 PAGE 3. 


Lisa turns off the mixer. Bart, unable to resist the 
frosting, grabs the still-whirling mixer and tries to lick 
it. His tongue gets caught. 
BART 
Hep! Hep! Lisa! My ungue! Hep - 
stuck in the eater, hep! 
INT. MASTER BEDROOM 
Homer and Marge are sound asleep in bed. The door CREAKS 
open and Bart, Lisa and Maggie all tiptoe quietly in, 
carrying the breakfast tray laden with pancakes. 
BART & LISA 
(TOP OF THEIR LUNGS) Happy birthday! 
HOMER 
(SHRIEKS) Huh? Whuh? Whuh? 
LISA 
Here's your birthday breakfast! 
Marge and Homer sit up in bed. 
MARGE 
(YAWNS; THEN TOUCHED) Well, isn't this 
nice? 
HOMER 
It's my birthday? 
LISA 
No! 
HOMER 
My birthday? My birthday. This is my 
birthday? What did I get? I love 


birthdays. 


FINAL DELIVERY 10/16/89 PAGE 4. 


MARGE 
(A LITTLE COLDLY) No, Homer. It's 
mine. 
BART 
You don't even know your own wife's 
birthday? 
HOMER 
(PANIC SETTING IN RAPIDLY) Of course I 
know! Sure! It's my wife's birthday. 
(TO MARGE) You really thought I 
forgot, didn't you? 
BART 
Oh right. What'd you get her, Dad? 
LISA 
Yeah, what'd you get? 


Homer gets out of bed and begins hurriedly putting on his 
clothes. 


HOMER 
(STALLING) Huh... a very thoughtful 
gift. But it's a surprise. 
(STRETCHING) You know it's such a 
beautiful morning, I think I'll take a 
little stroll around the block. 
Homer sidles out the door. We hear SPX: RAPID FOOTSTEPS 
GOING DOWNSTAIRS AND OUT THE FRONT DOOR. CAR DOOR SLAM. 
ENGINE STARTING UP. CAR SCREECHES OUT ONTO THE ROAD, 
SPRAYING GRAVEL AS IT ROARS AWAY. 
LISA 


I think he forgot, Mom.

MARGE 
Hmmm hmmm. 
EXT. SPRINGFIELD MALL - A FEW MINUTES LATER 
Homer's car 8QUEAL8 to a stop, parking illegally at the 
mall's entrance. A number of OLD PEOPLE are getting their 
morning exercise walking around the mall. Homer gets out 
and rushes at the locked metal gate in front of the mall's 
main entrance. 
HOMER 
(IRRITABLY) Oh, no. Come on, come on! 
Open up! 
The mall's gate is finally opened by a SECURITY GUARD. 
BLACK SECURITY GUARD 
Good morning, consumers. The 
Springfield Mall is now open for your 
spending needs. 
Homer, pushing aside all the old people, bolts inside. 


INT. MALL - CONTINUOUS 


Homer walks through the mall past several stores. First 
it's the "International House of Answering Machines." 


HOMER

MURMURS approval, then goes inside. 
INT. GIRDLES 'N* SUCH, FANCY LINGERIE = CONTINUOUS 
Homer holds up a short nightie that has three holes cut out 
of it in very important places. He looks at the pricetag 
which reads forty-five dollars. 
HOMER (CONT'D) 
(TO HIMSELF) Forty-five bucks. This 
thing wouldn't last three seconds with 


me in the roon. 


He holds up another nightie. It has one enormous hole in 
the center. 


INT. SIMPSON LIVING ROOM - A LITTLE LATER 
Marge is on the phone with her sisters PATTY and SELMA. 
MARGE 
(INTO PHONE) Patty, he's out buying me 
something right now. 
INTERCUT WITH: 
PATTY AND SELMA 


Patty is talking on the phone as Selma sits next to her on 
the couch, smoking and knitting. 


PATTY 
(INTO PHONE) Oh, Marge. He never gets 
you anything you want. He always gets 
something for himself. 

SELMA 
(TO PATTY) Like the tackle box.

PATTY 
(INTO PHONE) Remember when he got you 
the tackle box? 
SELMA 
(TO PATTY) And Connie Chung. 
PATTY 
(INTO PHONE) And when he "surprised" 
you with the Connie Chung calendar? (TO 
SELMA) Thank you, Selma.

deliberately. 
INT. THE JOCK SHOPPE 


Homer is eyeing a sharp-looking sixteen-pound bowling ball 
that is on sale.

waiters sing. 
SELMA 
(INTO PHONE) Mmn-hmm. 
INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - FOYER - A LITTLE LATER 
Homer comes in the front door. He sees Marge drinking 
coffee in the kitchen. He edges quickly to the hall 
closet, trying to keep the large package he is carrying out 
of sight. 
MARGE 
Homer? 
HOMER 
Be right there. 
Homer pushes the package into the top of the closet with a 
GRUNT, then joins Marge in the kitchen. He WHISTLES "The 
Hall Of The Mountain King." 
MARGE 
Homer, we're having dinner tonight at 
the Singing Sirloin. 
HOMER 
Ah, sounds delightful. Just you and me 
and the balladeers.

And the kids.

The marquee outside reads, "Home of Ballads and Salads". 
The logo is a steak singing with a microphone a la a young 
Frank Sinatra. 


INT. "THE SINGING SIRLOIN" 


OLD MAN WINFIELD and OLD LADY WINFIELD are holding hands 
and smiling as a quartet of WAITERS sing at their table.

CAMERA PANS TO ANOTHER TABLE 
A MIDDLE-AGED GROUP OF PEOPLE, dressed in black, sit at a 
table. The women are wearing black veils and wracked with 
grief. 
CAMERA PANS TO SIMPSON TABLE 
Marge, Homer, the kids, Patty and Selma are all seated 
around a large table. Marge is seated between her sisters 
and Homer is on the other side of the table. Dinner is 
over (except for Homer) and a birthday cake has been placed 
on the table. The kids are watching with tremendous 
repressed excitement as Marge opens the presents they have 
bought her. Lisa's "Whistler's Mother" portrait is on 
display. Marge is opening Bart's bottle of perfume. 
MARGE 
Oh, perfume. 
Marge SNIFFS it. Her eyes water and her head SNAPS back. 
MARGE 
Whoa... hmmm. Thank you, Bart. 
BART 
You're welcome, Mom. 
PATTY 
(TO MARGE) Thirty-four years old. 
SELMA 
(LOW, TO MARGE) Time enough to start 
over with a new man. 
PATTY 
(LOW, TO MARGE) Someone who eats with 
his mouth shut. 
Homer's mouth is full, food is spilling out of it. 
HOMER 


What's that, Patty? 


FINAL DELIVERY 10/16/89 PAGE 11. 


PATTY 
Nothing. Finish your steak. (LOW) 
Look at him wolf down that gristle. 
SELMA

waiting to happen. 
PATTY 
(LOW) Do you know the Heimlich 
Manuever? 
SELMA 
(LOW) No. 
PATTY 
(LOW) Good. (LAUGHS) 
Both CHUCKLE. Homer finishes eating. 
LISA 


(TO BART) I think she likes my present 


better. 

BART 
Does not. 

LISA 
Does too. 

BART 
Does not. 

LISA 
Does too. 

BART 


Does not. 


FINAL DELIVERY 10/16/89 


LISA 
Then how comes she's not putting on any 
of your perfume? 

BART 
Yeah. Hey, Mom. How come you're not 
putting on any of my perfume? 

MARGE 
Uh... I'm saving it... for a special 
occasion. 

BART 
What the hell are you talking about? 
There's gallons of it. 

HOMER 
Bart! 

MARGE 
But this occasion is already so special 
if we made it any more special, we 
might end up making it less special. 

BART 
Gotcha. (TO LISA) I told you she 
liked mine better. 

LISA 
Oh, brother. 

HOMER 
(AMIABLY) Hold on! Hold on now! Your 


mother hasn't opened my present yet.

FINAL DELIVERY 10/16/89 PAGE 13. 


Homer signals to a quartet of waiters to come to the table. 
He holds the box out over the table towards Marge. As 
Marge reaches for it, the bowling ball inside falls through 
the bottom of the box and imbeds itself like a cannonball 
in the birthday cake. All the lighted candles but one are 
buried and snuffed out. Before anyone can say anything, we 
hear a PITCHPIPE and four WAITERS appear next to the table 
and begin WARBLING away happily. 
4TH QUARTET OF WAITERS 

(SINGING) Happy birthday to you! 

Happy birthday to you! Happy 34th 

birthday, Mrs. Homer Simpson... Happy 

birthday to yooooo! 


The whole table is silent. Homer removes the ball and 
starts wiping it off. 


HOMER 
(SHRIEK) Whoop! Don't worry. This 
frosting will come right off. Beauty, 
isn't she? 
Marge is staring daggers at Homer. 
MARGE 
Well, it's hard for me to judge 
(ANGRILY) since I've never bowled in my 
life. 
HOMER 
(PLAYFULLY) Well, if you don't want 
it, I know someone who does. 
Marge SNORTS, blowing out the one remaining candle.

FADE IN: 


INT. MARGE & HOMER'S BEDROOM - THAT NIGHT 


Marge is lying in bed, immobile, staring at the ceiling. 
Homer is sitting on the edge of the bed, talking to Marge. 


HOMER 
You always say we should talk. Well, 
I'm trying to talk. I'm talking right 
now, aS a matter of fact. But I'm 
going to stop in a second. So, please 
say something back, Marge, please. I'm 
going to stop talking ... now. Your 
turn, please. 

MARGE 
You bought that bowling ball for you, 
not for me. 

HOMER 
What? No... 

MARGE 
The holes were drilled for your 
fingers. 

HOMER 
(DEFENSIVELY) I wanted to surprise 
you. I couldn't very well chop your 
hand off and bring it to the store, 


could I? 


FINAL DELIVERY 10/16/89 PAGE 15. 


MARGE 
You never intended for me to use that 
ball. 

HOMER 
Well, if that's how you feel, I'll take 
it back. 

MARGE 
You can't take it back. You had your 
name engraved on it. 

HOMER 
So you'd know it's from me! 

MARGE 
(GRIM) Homer, I'm keeping the ball. 
For myself. 

HOMER 
(TAKEN ABACK) What? But you don't 
know how to bowl!... whoops. 

MARGE 
(GRIM) I'm keeping it and I'm going to 
use it. Thank you for the present, 
Homer. 

Marge shuts off the light. 

HOMER 

(PAUSE) Well... you're welcome. 
INT. BARNEY'S NEW BOWL-A-RAMA = THE NEXT AFTERNOON 


Marge enters the alley carrying her bowling ball clumsily 
in her arms. She looks around in bewildern 


FINAL DELIVERY 10/16/89 PAGE 16. 


ent. SFX: THUMPING OF BALLS, CLATTERING OF PINS. There is 
a sign that says "Beginners Welcome." She walks up to the 
counter, where a sign says "We have a deal with the bank. 
They don't offer you fine value for your bowling dollar, 
and we don't accept checks." The GUY behind the counter is 
spraying the insides of bowling shoes. Marge catches his 
eye. 
MARGE 
(HOLDING UP BALL TENTATIVELY) Excuse 
me... where do I throw this? 


The counter guy jerks his thumb over his shoulder at the 
lanes. 


COUNTER GUY 
Over there. 
MARGE 
Thank you. 
Marge starts to walk towards the lanes, raising the ball 
over her head with both hands, getting ready to heave it. 
The counter guy calls her back. 
COUNTER GUY 
Hey, wait a minute. You're gonna need 
a lane. 
MARGE 
No, thanks. I'm just here out of 
spite. 


The counter guy points to a small sign that says "You Can't 
Bowl Without A Lane." 


COUNTER GUY 
Can't bowl without a lane. 
MARGE 
Hmmm. Well... all right. 


e counter guy tears off a scoresheet and hands it to her. 


FINAL DELIVERY 10/16/89 PAGE 17. 


COUNTER GUY 
Okay, here you go. You keep score on 
this. What size shoes you wear? 
MARGE 
(PRIMLY) Never you mind. 


Counter guy points to a sign which reads, "You Can't Wear 
Street Shoes On the Lanes." 


COUNTER GUY 
(PATIENTLY) Can't wear street shoes on 
the lanes. You gotta wear bowling 
shoes. What size please? 

MARGE 
(SOFTLY) Thirteen. Double A. 

COUNTER GUY 
Thirteen double A (WHISTLES) . 

MARGE

Counter guy hands her a pair of shoes, one larger than the 
other.

LANE 14 


In the background a tall blond man, JACQUES gracefully 
rolls a strike. Marge is finishing putting on her shoes. 


MARGE 
(TO HERSELF) A little warm and moist. 
(ANNOYED MURMUR) . 
She picks up her ball in both hands and steps up onto the 
lane. She walks up to the foul line, looks around with a 
"Is this right?" expression on her face, then -- with both 
hands -- tosses the ball into the air in the general 
direction of the pins. The ball THUDS onto the lane, 
bounces a couple of times and wobbles down the lane, 
knocking over the "7" pin. Marge looks at the lane next to 
hers as Jacques gets another strike and a small cluster of 
GROUPIES CHEER. Marge picks up her ball and tries again. 
The ball goes exactly to the same spot. She then enters 
her score on her scoresheet. 
MARGE 
(WRITING) One. 
In the lane next to hers, Jacques throws another strike and 
the groupies CHEER. Marge watches as Jacques' OPPONENT 
hands over a small pile of money to Jacques and exits, head 
down. 
JACQUES 
(TO GROUPIES - THICK ACCENT) So -- one 
hundred and twenty pins later, I am the 
better man. 


The contest over, the groupies begin to disperse and 
Jacques notices Marge. 


MARGE 
(TO HERSELF) I don't see what he's 
doing that's so different from what I'm 


doing. 


FINAL DELIVERY 10/16/89 PAGE 19. 


Marge walks smartly up to the foul line, steps, and chucks 
the ball in the air, a little higher this time. It comes 
down in the gutter, bounces into Jacques' lane and knocks 
over his "7" pin. 
MARGE 
(EMBARRASSED) Oh! 
Their eyes meet. 
CLOSE-UP = JACQUES FACE 


He is looking at her with a heavy-lidded lounge lizard 
expression. 


NEW ANGLE 


Jacques retrieves Marge's ball from the ball return and 
brings it back to her. 


MARGE 
I'm awfully sorry. 
JACQUES 
Entirely my fault. (PAUSE) It is nice 
to meet you... (LOOKS AT HER BALL)... 
Homer. 
She takes the ball from hin. 
MARGE 
(FLUSTERED) Oh, no no. Homer is ny... 
ball's name. I'm Marge. 
Jacques places his hand on hers, which is on the 
illuminated scoring table, and runs the tips of his fingers 
over it. 
MARGE 
(SLIGHT SURPRISED GASP) 


We see their hands project on the overhead scoreboard. 


FINAL DELIVERY 10/16/89 PAGE 20. 


JACQUES 
Your fingers are so slender, so 
feminine. They are far too tapered for 
the ball you are using. You need 
something lighter, more delicate. 
Here, use my ball. 
He holds out his ball to her. She backs away a little. 
MARGE 
No... no thank you, Mr... uh... (LOOKS 
AT THE NAME ON HIS BALL)... Brunswick. 
JACQUES 


Call me Jacques. 


MARGE 
Jacques. 

JACQUES 
Marge. 

MARGE 


Hmmm. I'11 just use my ball. 

JACQUES 
(PHILOSOPHICALLY) As you wish. Many 
people have senseless attachments to 
heavy, clumsy things such as this 
"Homer" of yours. 


His face moves uncomfortably close to hers. His eyelids 
and lower lip droop senuously. 


MARGE 


FINAL DELIVERY 10/16/89 


JACQUES 

May I ask you a bold question? 
MARGE 

Sure. 
JACQUES 


You've never bowled before? 


MARGE 
Never. 

JACQUES 
No? 

MARGE 
No. 

JACQUES 


Then I will teach you. 
MARGE 
Oh, I don't want to trouble you. 
JACQUES 
Not at all. I ama professional. Roll 
the ball for me, Marge. Let me see 
your form. 
MARGE 
All right. But I'm not very good. 


Marge picks up her ball and heaves it. It follows the same 
trajectory, and knocks over the "7" pin. 


MARGE (CONT'D) 
I can hit that one pin all right. But 


the rest of them don't even wobble. 


PAGE 21. 


FINAL DELIVERY 10/16/89 PAGE 22. 


JACQUES 
I can help you, Marge. Pick up your 
ball. Pick up Homer. Pick him up. 
MARGE 
Ohhh, Homer! 


Marge picks up her ball. Jacques lines her body up with 
the pins. 


She slumps. He picks her up like a ballet dancer lifting a 
ballerina. Marge SQUEAKS with surprise. He sets her down 
almost in the next lane. 


JACQUES 
Now throw! 

MARGE 
But... 

JACQUES 


Throw, damn you! 


Marge heaves the ball. It THUDS on the lane. As a result 


of her new starting point, it knocks down all the remaining 
pins. 


MARGE 
(GASPS) Why, you're a very good 
teacher. 
Marge's face is flushed with triumph. A few strands of her 
hair are dangling in front of her eyes. She brushes them 
aside, girlishly. They flop back. Jacques reaches up, 


suavely licks the entire palm of his hand, and pastes the 
hairs back into place. 


FINAL DELIVERY 10/16/89 


JACQUES 
Yes, I am a very good teacher and I can 
teach you everything. I can tell you 
what the little arrows on the wood 
floor mean. Which frame is the beer 
frame. I bet you don't know how to 
make a 5-7-10 split, do you, Marge? 


MARGE 


JACQUES 
But first of all you yell.. the eight 
pin is a cop. 

MARGE 
(LAUGHING) 

JACQUES 
Let it out, Marge. Laugh loud. Laugh 
out loud. You'll lose weight. 

MARGE 
Oh, that's very funny. 

JACQUES 
Feels good. 

MARGE 
Oh dear. I didn't realize there was so 
much to this game. What do you charge 


for lessons?

MARGE 
Twenty-five dollars!

It's a forty-dollar value. 
MARGE 
Oh. Well... all right. When do we 
start? 
JACQUES 
We have already begun.

Homer and the kids are sitting at the table. Homer sets a 


pizza carton down and opens it. 
HOMER

kids? Hot pizza... the food of kings. 


LISA 


Don't be scared, Dad. It's not so hard 


taking care of us. 
HOMER 


(LAUGHS) Lisa. I'm not scared. I 


think it's a great chance to spend some 


time with you kids. Your mother always 


gets to be alone with you and now it's

Jacques is crouching on the alley, feeling it with his

JACQUES 
(SENSUOUSLY) First you must get to 
know your lane. Feel the slickness. 
Feel the satiny finish. Caress it. 


Experience it. You could eat off of 


it. 

MARGE 
Hmmm. 

JACQUES 
You hungry? 

MARGE 
Yes. 

JACQUES

HOMER 
Okay. We've eaten and eaten well. Now 
What else do we have to do? Well, 
let's check the list your Mom left us. 
Homer looks at the list. 
HOMER (CONT'D) 
Eat. Hmmm hmmm. 
Homer checks it off. 
HOMER (CONT'D) 
Ooh. Clean up. Now don't worry, 
everybody. This'll be a breeze if we 
all pitch in. 
Homer closes the pizza carton and hands it to Bart. The 
table is now perfectly clean. Bart hands it to Lisa. Lisa 
hands it to Maggie, who is in her highchair. Maggie hands 
it to Lisa who hands it to Homer. Homer hands it to Bart. 
Bart throws it in the garbage. 
HOMER (CONT'D) 
All right, we're clean. Now we'll...

EXT. BOWLING ALLEY - PARKING LOT 


Jacques is walking Marge to her car. The moon is shining 
down. 


JACQUES 
I believe everyone has the perfect 
bowling form locked up inside of then. 
I will devote my life to finding yours. 
That is my vow. 

MARGE 
For twenty-five dollars? 

JACQUES 
I told you it was a forty-dollar value. 


MARGE 


JACQUES 
By the way. A vow for under fifty is a 
fantastic deal. 
MARGE

INT. SIMPSON LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Homer is asleep in bed, SNORING loudly. Marge enters from 
the bathroom in her nightgown, looks at him guiltily and 
climbs into bed.

HOMER 
(HALF ASLEEP) Ahhh... ahhh... Oh, how

MARGE 
It's a very challenging hobby. 
HOMER 
(CHUCKLES SLEEPILY) Sport, dear, it's 
a sport, you silly thing. 
MARGE 
Mmm-hmm. But I think I'1l do much 
better tomorrow night. 
HOMER 
You're going back? 
MARGE 
Well sure, if you don't mind taking 
care of the kids, again?

MARGE 
Goodnight, Homer. 
HOMER 
Night. 
INT. BOWLING ALLEY - NEXT NIGHT 
Marge is looking a little more proficient now. She GRUNTS 
as she bowls and MURMURS excitedly as she knocks over nine 
pins. As she waits for her ball, Jacques is next to her. 
He grabs her hands and brings them over the automatic hand- 
dryer. Their eyes meet. His are smouldering. Hers are 


confused. We begin a MONTAGE of sensuous, slow-motion 
EXTREME CLOSEUPS, reminiscent of "9-1/2 Weeks."

Uh oh. School bus. 
Bart enters from upstairs. Lisa enters from the living 
room and Marge enters from the kitchen carrying two huge 
lunchbags that have French bread baguettes, fruit and a 
donut box sticking out of each. Bart's also includes a 
comic book and Lisa's has a toy pony. 
MARGE 
Here you go, kids. Special lunches. 
Lots of good things for growing bodies 
and some treats just for fun. 
She hands them the bags, which are very heavy. 
BART 
Whoa. Aye carumba! 
LISA 
Are you going bowling again tonight, 
Mom? 
MARGE 
Well yes I am, as a matter of fact. 
Here's more treats. But don't worry, 
your Dad will take care of dinner.

Mmm. Wednesday -- hoagie night. 
Marge hugs Lisa too hard and kisses her too long.

INT. SCHOOL BUS 
Lisa and Bart sit next to each other holding their huge 
sacks between their knees. Bart is eating donuts and 
reading a comic book. 
BART 
Great lunches, eh Lis? 
LISA 
Oh, Bart, don't you see? This is what 
psychologists call over-compensation. 
Mom is racked with guilt because her 
marriage is failing. 
BART 
Hey, don't rock the boat, man. 
Whatever it is, we're making out like 
bandits. 
LISA 
Bart, I read about what happens to kids 
whose parents no longer love and 
cherish each other. They go through 
eight separate stages. Right now, I'm 
in Stage 3, fear. You're in Stage 2,

No I'm not.

Bart leans in eye-to-eye with Lisa, backing her against the

BART 
Am not, am not, am not! 
LISA

corrected. 
INT. MARGE & HOMER'S BEDROOM - EARLY EVENING 
Homer is taking off his shirt. He starts to turn away, but 
stops when he sees something sticking out of one of the 
drawers. He pulls the object out and looks at it. It isa 
delicately made bowling glove. He stares at it stupidly 
for a moment, reads it, then carefully puts it back. After 
a moment, Marge comes in and begins getting ready to go 
out. Homer watches her. Neither says anything. Finally, 
Homer speaks. 
HOMER 
Are you going bowling again tonight? 
MARGE 
(NOT LOOKING AT HIM) Yes. 
HOMER 
(HESITATES. THEN...) At the bowling 


alley?

MARGE 
Yes. 
HOMER 
Well... (GIVING IT UP)... have a good 
time. 
MARGE 
Okay. 
She opens the drawer and takes out her bowling glove. She 
puts it inside her purse, CLICKING the clasp shut, then 
exits. Homer watches her go and sits slumped with his head 
on his chest. After a beat, Bart enters, very cheery, with 
baseball gloves and a ball. 
BART 
(CHEERY) Hey, Dad. What do you say we 
toss the ol' apple around, huh? Sound 
like fun? 
HOMER 
(EXHAUSTED) Son, I don't know if I can 
lift my head, let alone a ball. 
BART 
Aw, come on, Dad. Get the lead out. 
He takes Homer by the arm and starts to lead him out. 
EXT. YARD = EARLY EVENING 


Homer is standing like a zombie, his arms hanging at his 
side. Lisa sits on the steps watching then. 


BART 
Simpson checks the runner on first. 
He's cool. He's fine. Here's the 


windup and... here's the pitch. 


FINAL DELIVERY 10/16/89 PAGE 34. 


Bart throws the ball. Homer doesn't move and the ball HITS 
him squarely on the forehead. He drops to the ground and 
lies there, staring straight up. 
BART 
Dad, you didn't even say ouch. 
HOMER 
Oh. Sorry... ouch! 
Bart runs over to where Lisa is sitting. 
BART 
Lisa, Lisa! I think you're right about 
Dad. Something's very, very wrong 
here. 
LISA 
Frightened, Bart? Welcome to Stage 3: 
Fear. 
BART 
Well come on. We gotta do something, 
Man. 
LISA 
Sorry, Bart. I'd love to help you but 
I'm mired in Stage 5, self-pity. 
Bart goes back to Homer. 
BART 
Look, Dad. I don't know what's going 
on, but once you gave me some advice 
that might help. 
HOMER 


I gave you advice? Get outta here. 


FINAL DELIVERY 10/16/89 PAGE 35. 


BART 
Yeah. You did! You told me when 
something's bothering you, and you're 
too damn stupid to know what to do, 
just keep your fool mouth shut. At 
least that way you won't make things 
worse. 
HOMER 
Hmmm. Good advice. 
INT. BOWLING ALLEY - NIGHT 
With romantic MUSIC in the b.g., Marge and Jacques sweep 
majestically up to adjacent foul lines and gracefully roll 
strike after strike. The rhythmic THUDDING and SCATTERING 
OF PINS punctuates the music perfectly. 
EXT. SIMPSON HOUSE - LATE THAT NIGHT 
Jacques and Marge drive up in Jacques' convertible. 
Marge's hair is blown straight back out over the trunk. 
Jacques turns off the engine. 
JACQUES

You didn't have to drop me off. 
JACQUES

Marge darling, I want to see you 
tomorrow. Not at Barney's Bowl-A-Rama. 
Away from the thunderous folly of 
clattering pins. Meet me tomorrow for 
brunch. 

MARGE 
What's brunch? 

JACQUES 
You'd love it. It's not quite 
breakfast, it's not quite lunch, but it 
comes with a slice of cantalope at the 
end. You don't get completely what you 
would at breakfast, but you get a good 
meal.

eyes slowly open.

Marge and Jacques are seated opposite each other at a 
corner table in the coffee shop. Marge is nervous, afraid 


to be seen. 
JACQUES 
Mimosa? 
MARGE 
I'm a married woman. Please don't call 
me that. 


Jacque, thinking she is joking, LAUGHS. Marge, not knowing 
exactly why, LAUGHS too. 


JACQUES 
(LAUGHING) No, no, no, no. Mimosa is 
the name of the drink. It is orange 
juice and champagne. You're so 
wonderful that you thought it was 
something offensive. 

MARGE 
Oh. Well, thank you. 


Suddenly they are joined by HELEN LOVEJOY, a cheerful Jane 
Wyatt-kind of person.

me, don't you? I'm Helen Lovejoy, the 
gossipy wife of the minister. 

MARGE 
Oh... yes, hello, Helen. 

HELEN 
Well, I had just finished eating and 
was about to leave when I looked over 
this way and said to myself, "Why, 
isn't that Marge Simpson over there? 
Having brunch with a man who isn't her 
husband?" And I just had to come over 
and say hello. 

MARGE 
We're... uh... 

HELEN 
Oh, don't squirm on my account. 

JACQUES 
I am giving her a bowling lesson, thank 
you. 


Jacque begins moving salt and pepper shakers to certain 
points on the table. 


JACQUES (CONT'D) 
Now, Marge. The pins on the 3-7-10 
split would be here. We'll make this 
little piece of food the ball. The 


ball's bigger, you know that...

Well, I just wanted to stop by and say 
hello and see if I could dig up a 
little good-natured dirt. Bye bye. 
See you in church on Sunday, Marge. 
MARGE 
Goodbye, Helen. 
JACQUES 
Goodbye, Helen. 
Helen exits. 
JACQUES 
You have a lovely friend, there. Let's 
hope something runs over her. 
MARGE

JACQUES 
Your laughter is like music to me. But 
if you laugh at what I say next, I will 
die, for I am about to say something 
very serious... perhaps shocking. 
Marge, my darling, I want you to meet 


with me again.

HOMER 
(STRUGGLING FOR THE RIGHT WORDS) 
Marge, may I speak to you? 
MARGE 
Sure. 
HOMER 
You know I've been thinking... everyone 
makes peanut butter and jelly 
sandwiches, but usually the jelly drips 
out over the sides and a guy's hands 
get all sticky. But your jelly stays 
right in the middle where it's supposed 
to. I don't know how you do it. 
You've just got a gift, I guess. I've 
always thought so. I just never 
mentioned it. But it's time you knew 
how I feel. I don't believe in 
keeping feelings bottled up.

the right one. On the counter are enough fragrance and 
grooming products to stock a Thrifty Jr.

INT. SIMPSON CAR 


As Marge continues down the road she passes a church and 
sees a NEWLYWED COUPLE emerge, getting rice thrown at then. 
Marge shields her vision with her left hand. She then sees 
a YOUNG COUPLE with a baby stroller. She then sees a 
pleasant FAMILY having a picnic. She drives past the zoo 
and there is an APE FAMILY looking back at her. The Mother 
and Father Ape are holding hands. Further down the road 
she sees an OLD COUPLE holding hands, then two graves side- 
by-side in the town cemetery, then two skeletons side-by- 
side holding hands in a costume shop window. 


MARGE POV 


She is rapidly coming to a fork in the road. The right 
fork leads to the "Fiesta Terrace" and the left fork leads 
to the nuclear power plant. 


NEW ANGLE 


Marge's car -- without a moment's hesitation -- takes the 
right fork and heads for Bjorn's apartment. One hundred 
yards down the road, the car SCREECHES to a stop and backs 
up with its tires spinning. Marge is looking out the back 
window and draping her right arm over the backseat as she 
backs up. When the car gets to the fork, it turns left and 
heads for the power plant. One hundred yards toward the 
plant, the car SCREECHES to a stop again, then slowly backs 
up until it gets to the fork in the road. It stops there 
and idles.

All of Homer's CO-WORKERS turn from the gauges and machines 
they're supposed to be watching and APPLAUD as Homer starts 
to carry Marge triumphantly out of the room. MUSIC swells 
again.

Way to go, Homer. Way to go.

(TO HOMER) Hey, what'll I tell the 
boss? 
HOMER 
Tell him I'm going to the backseat of 
my car with the woman I love and I 
won't be back for ten minutes. 
The dials start going crazy, indicating a possible terminal 
meltdown, but none of the workers notice it. They continue 
grinning, CHEERING and APPLAUDING as Homer carries Marge 
out past the flashing warning lights.

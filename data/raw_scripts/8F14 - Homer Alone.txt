ACT ONE 
FADE IN: 
INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - MORNING 
A scared BART, in his pajamas, runs into the living room. 
FREEZE FRAME ON BART 


A "Road Runner" type subtitle appears under his head with a 
PING. It reads: 


BART 
(brat’us don’thaveacow’us) 
Resume action as HOMER runs in after him in his underwear. 
HOMER 
(GROWLS) 
FREEZE FRAME ON HOMER 


The freeze frame catches his flabby belly in mid-bounce. 
The subtitle line underneath him reads: 


HOMER 
(homo neanderthal/’us) 
LOSE FREEZE FRAME 


Homer chases Bart past MARGE. They knock over a lamp which 
CRASHES at her feet. 


MARGE 
I am not cleaning that... (TO SELF) Ah, 
who am I kidding? 


Marge begins to clean up the mess.

INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - MAGGIE’S BEDROOM - MORNING 
Marge swoops into the room, with a bottle of formula. She 
tries to pull out Maggie’s pacifier which stretches and 
pulls MAGGIE into the air. 
MARGE 
Now Maggie, when you grow up you can 
suck your pacifier all you want. 
Marge quickly pulls out the pacifier and shoves the bottle 
in Maggie’s mouth. Marge begins to change Maggie’s diaper 
with great skill. She throws the soiled diaper over her 
shoulder; it lands cleanly in the hamper. She applies a 
baby wipe with one hand, and baby powder with the other. 
She attaches the new diaper, plucks out the bottle, throws 
Maggie over her shoulder, and delivers two crisp pats. 
MAGGIE 
(BARNEY-LIKE BURP) 
Marge quickly scurries Maggie out of the room. 


INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING 


Marge frantically makes the family’s school and work 
lunches, preparing three sandwiches concurrently. 


MARGE 
(SQUEEZING MUSTARD BOTTLE) Extra 
mustard for Bart, sliced diagonally not 
lengthwise... Light mayo for Lisa, cut 
off the crust... (REMOVING BREAD CRUST) 
Double bologna for Homer.... 


Bart and LISA race in and begin to talk at the same time. 


BART LISA 
Mom, did you see my lucky Mom, can you sig this per-

lucky red cap? Mom, aren’t trip? Mom, I hate those

I told you. Mom, hello (ETC.) me gag. (ETC 
As the kids continue talking Homer enters and chimes in. 
HOMER 
Marge, I split my pants again. Oooh, 
can I have two sandwiches today? Make 
them bologna sandwiches too. Can I 
have two slices of bologna and 
cheese... (ETC.) 
MARGE 
One at a time! One at a time! 


Homer and the kids all stop for a BEAT, then start up 
again. 


BART/HOMER/LISA 
(AD-LIB) Don’t even bother with the 
raisins. I’m not gonna eat ‘em... 
Double bologna! Double bologna!... I 
don’t ask for much, just no pimento. 
MARGE 
That’s enough! 


With her index finger Marge rapidly pokes the pimentos out 
of Lisa's bologna. 


MARGE (CONT’D) 
There you go, Lisa. No pimentos. Bart, 
your hat’s where you left it, behind 
the toilet. Homer, I’11l sew your pants 


but I’m out of bologna.

INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - MORNING 
Marge races to the door with her arms full. Maggie is 
tucked firmly under one arm. The cat is in a cage in her 
right hand. 
MARGE 
Videos to return, grocery list, flea 
dip for the cat, Homer’s dry-cleaning —- 
- I think that’s everything. 
Homer approaches with his bowling ball. 
HOMER 
Marge, can you take my ball to Nick’s 
today? A bottle cap got lodged in the 
finger hole. 
MARGE 
Homer, I’m running late as it is. Can’t 
you just use one of the balls at the 
alley? 
HOMER 
(WHINY) Alley balls? 
MARGE 
(GRUFF) Alright, don’t whine. Just put 


it in my left hand. 


8F14 FINAL DELIVERY 7/26/91 


Homer puts the ball in Marge’s left hand. Her body shifts 
to that side. She looks out the window and notices the 
school bus is there. 
MARGE (CONT’D) 
(YELLING) Kids! Hurry up or you’re 
going to miss your bus! 
LISA 
No way. 
BART 
Never happen. 
The bus PEELS OUT without them. 
BART (CONT’D) 
Well, I’11 be damned. 
Marge MURMURS. 
INT. MARGE’S CAR - MORNING 
Marge drives Bart and Lisa to school, darting between cars 
like a madwoman. Maggie sits in the babyseat next to her, 
chewing on her seat belt. The cat is on the floor. In the 
backseat, Bart makes a hideous monster face at Lisa. 
LISA 
Mom, Bart’s making faces at me. 
BART 
It’s a nervous twitch and I’m a little 
sensitive about it if you don’t mind. 
Bart makes a series of faces at Lisa. 
LISA 
Mom, he’s doing it again. Bart, quit 
it! Quit it! Hey quit it! Quit it! 


Quit it! Mommmmn!! 


Ss 


8F14 FINAL DELIVERY 7/26/91 


(NOTE: Everytime Lisa says "Quit it!" Bart changes to 
another gruesome face.}] Marge screeches up to the school. 
She turns to the kids with total fury in her eyes. 
MARGE 
(A LA AMITYVILLE) Get out. 
Bart and Lisa nervously scurry out of the car. 
INT. DRY CLEANERS - MORNING 
A fat CLERK hands Marge a freshly laundered shirt which 
reads "Homer" over the pocket. Marge looks at the check 
attached to the hanger. 
MARGE 
(OUTRAGED) Twenty two dollars for one 
shirt!? 
CLERK 
(SHAKING HIS HEAD) There was some kind 
of stain under the arms -- I’1l tell 
ya, fifteen years in this business, 
I’ve never seen anything like it. 
Marge GROANS and reaches in her purse. 
INT. SUPERMARKET - MORNING 
Maggie sits in a shopping cart, watching Marge race down 
the aisle, frantically pulling what she needs from the 
shelves. 
MARGE 
(FRENZIED) Fruit leather... Tree Fresh 
Imitation Orange Drink... Krusty brand 
duck sausage pizza... 


Marge throws the food items into the cart and races back 
down the aisle. Maggie puts the items back on the nearest 


shelf.

INT. NICK’S BOWLING SHOP - MORNING 


Homer’s bowling ball sits on the counter. The clerk sits 
on his stool, shaking his head at Marge. 


NICK 
Sorry lady, You’ve got the wrong 
Nick’s. You want Nick’s on the other 
side of town. 
INT. THE OTHER NICKS - A LITTLE LATER 
NICK #2 
(WISE GUY VOICE) Eh, I don’t know what 
Nicky’s telling you. I haven’t flushed 
a ball in years. 
Marge lugs Homer’s bowling ball out of the shop, with 
Maggie tucked under her other arm. The bowling ball slams 
repeatedly against her leg. 
INT. MARGE’S CAR - MORNING 
Marge turns on the car radio to calm her frayed nerves. 
SFX: JACK HAMMER 
COMMERCIAL GUY (V.O.) 
Oh, this miserable stress headache. 
Feels like there’s a rat in my brain. 
Marge quickly changes the station. 
BILL (V.0.) 
(CHUCKLES) It’s time for another Bill 
and Marty (ECHO EFFECT) Classic Crank 
Call.

Oh God! No! 

MARTY (V.O.) 
(STIFLING LAUGH) That’s right. She 
just walked through a plate glass 
window. There’s blood everywhere. 

MAN ON PHONE (V.O.) 
And I just talked to her! (SOBS) 


Bill and Marty LAUGH uproariously. Marge SLAMS off the 
radio. 


MARGE 
(END OF ROPE) AHHH! ! 
EXT. SPRINGFIELD MEMORIAL BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS 


Marge’s station wagon begins to cross over the two lane 
bridge. A large bus is gaining rapidly from behind. 


INT. MARGE’S STATION WAGON - CONTINUOUS 
We see the bus bearing down in the rear view mirror. All 
the irritating voices from Marge’s day blend into one. We 
see their heads -- Bill and Marty are represented by a 
radio. We also see and HEAR a jackhammer. 
LISA (V.0.) 
Bart’s making faces. 
BART (V.0.) 
Where’s my lucky red cap? 
HOMER (V.0.)

I haven’t flushed a ball in years. 
In the car at the same time, Maggie’s bottle of formula 
clogs. She uncaps the bottle with a jerk, sending sticky 
baby formula over herself, the just picked up dry cleaning 
and, most critically, Marge. 
MARGE 
(SNAPPING) Nooo00000!! 
Marge slams on her brakes. 


EXT. SPRINGFIELD MEMORIAL BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS 


Marge’s car skids to a stop diagonally, blocking both lanes 
of traffic.

Very calmly, almost zombie-like, Marge puts her car into 
PARK and turns off the ignition. 


INT. BUS = CONTINUOUS 
A burly BUS DRIVER hops down from the bus which is 
labelled, "Shelbyville Players." We see ACTORS in costume 
inside. The bus driver walks over to Marge’s car and taps 
on the window. 
BUS DRIVER 

(GRUFF) Look, lady, this better be 

good. 
Marge turns to him and makes a GUTTURAL APE-LIKE SOUND, 
showing her teeth and spraying spittle across the inside of 
the rolled up window.

The truck driver backs off.

with her fists tightly clenched around the wheel. To the

down in the Channel Six Sky Harness for 

an exclusive interview. 
Kent wearing a helmet camera, is harnessed and lowered to 
Marge’s car. The copter winch overshoots the car, banging

YELLS in pain. He is pulled up next to the station wagon 
giving a "roll down your window" motion.

Swim, play tennis or just sit and stare

Homer starts to come out the front door with Maggie, who

just stay with you. 
SELMA 
Are you sure that’s wise? 
PATTY 
Uh-huh. He’ll probably trade her for a

You got it, sweetheart. You have 
enough blanket there? 

MARGE 
(PLEASED) Well, I could use a little 
more. And sometimes I want a little 
time to myself, and I expect you to 
help -- 


The light is suddenly turned on. Bart, Lisa and Maggie are 
also in bed, clinging desperately to Marge. 


BART 
(GIVING IN) Mom, I think I speak for 
everyone in this bed when I say you 
have nothing to worry about. Now let’s 
just try and get a little shut eye, 
okay? 


Bart turns the light out again. The Simpsons heave a 
mutual SIGE of relief. 


FADE OUT: 


THE END

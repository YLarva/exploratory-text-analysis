PADE IN: 
INT. CLASSROOM - MORNING 
MARTIN PRINCE sits alone on a stool in front of the class. 
"Papa: Reflections by Martin" is written on the board 
behind him. He is dressed in an elaborate costume as 
ERNEST HEMINGWAY, complete with an overstuffed cableknit 
sweater, a Greek fisherman's cap, a pipe, and false 
peppered beard. He is brandishing a copy of "The Old Man 
And The Sea." 
MARTIN 

(AS HEMINGWAY) And when I wrote the 

final line of my book (OPENS BOOK), 

",..the old man was dreaming of the 

lions again...", I didn't mean he was 

literally dreaming of lions, although 

as an avid hunter I have bagged quite 

of few of them myself. I merely meant 

that he was wistfully recalling the 

virility of his youth. 
ON CLASSROOM 
There is a smattering of POLITE APPLAUSE. The KIDS 
exchange looks indicating they think Martin is weird. MRS. 
KRABAPPEL breaks into emotional APPLAUSE. 

KRABAPPEL 


Very good, Martin. 


TABLE DRAFT 3/16/90 PAGE 2. 


MARTIN 
(HAND UP) Please call me Papa. 


As Martin returns to his desk to sit down, BART slips a 
packet of ketchup under his seat. 


BART 
Little ketchup between your buns, Papa? 
(LAUGHS) 

KRABAPPEL 
All right, class, I think that we have 
time for one more book report -- who 
would like to go next? 


Bart immediately stops LAUGHING and ducks behind Martin's 
enormous outfit. 


KRABAPPEL 
(FROM ATTENDANCE LIST) Bart Simpson? 
KRABAPPEL'S POV 
as Bart's head suddenly appears from behind Martin. 
BART 
Yes, ma'am? 
KRABAPPEL 
Is your book report on "Treasure 
Island" ready? 
Bart grabs his book and shuffles to the front of the class. 
BART 
Well, as Mrs. Krabappel already 
mentioned, the name of the book that I 
read was "Treasure Island". 


Bart writes "Treasure Island" on the blackboard. 


TABLE DRAFT 3/16/90 PAGE 3. 


BART (CONT'D) 
(LOOKING AT BOOK) It's about these 
pirates. Pirates who wear patches over 
their eyes... and shiny gold teeth... 
and parrots on their shoulders... 
TREASURE ISLAND BOOK COVER 


A PIRATE with an eye patch, a shiny gold tooth and a PARROT 
on his shoulder. 


BART (CONT'D) 
And the pirates live on an island. But 
not just any island. It's an island 
filled with many, many different 
treasures... hence the title, Treasure 
Island. Did I mention this book was 
written by a man named Robert Louis 
Stevenson, (TURNS BOOK OVER) the famous 
author of "Kidnapped?" 
TIME DISSOLVE - ONE MINUTE OFF THE SCHOOL CLOCK 
BART (CONT'D) 
(REALLY STRUGGLING) So in conclusion, 
on the Simpsons' scale of ten, ten 
being the highest, I give this book... 
a nine. 
Bart writes a big "9" on the board. 
BART (CONT'D) 
(CLEARING THROAT) Any questions? 


Mrs. Krabappel raises her hand in the back of the class. 


TABLE DRAFT 3/16/90 PAGE 4. 


BART (CONT'D) 
Yes, ma'am? 

KRABAPPEL 
(RUBBING HER EYES) Bart, did you read 
the book? 

BART 
Of course. 

KRABAPPEL 
Then perhaps you'd like to tell us the 
name of the pirate. 

BART 
Why certainly. The name of the pirate 
would be one... Bluebeard. 

KRABAPPEL 
Sit down, Bart. I'll see you after 
class. 

BART 
Captain Nemo? 

KRABAPPEL 
Please sit down. 

BART 
(AS HE SITS DOWN) Long John Silver? 

INT. CLASSROOM - AFTER SCHOOL 


Bart writes "I will not fake my way through life" on the 
board. Krabappel stands behind him with her arms folded. 


KRABAPPEL 


Bart, I'm very concerned. 


TABLE DRAFT 3/16/90 PAGE 5. 


BART 
(HEAD DOWN) Yes, ma'am. 
KRABAPPEL 
Your grades have gotten steadily worse 
since the beginning of the term, are 
you aware of that? 
BART 
(NODDING) Yes, ma'am. 
KRABAPPEL 
Are you aware that there is a major 
exam tomorrow on Colonial America? 
BART 
Yes, ma'am. 
BART'S POV 
as Krabappel continues to speak. 
KRABAPPEL'S MOUTH 
Blah, blah, blah, blah? (PAUSE) 
BART 
Yes, ma'an. 
KRABAPPEL'S MOUTH 
Blah, blah, blah, blah... (PAUSE) 
BART 
Yes, ma'an. 
INT. ARCADE - AFTERNOON 
SUPER: 3:42 P.M. SFX: TELETYPE 


Bart plays "Escape From Grandma's House" with intensity. 


TABLE DRAFT 3/16/90 PAGE 


ON THE VIDEO SCREEN 
A SMALL BOY runs away from GRANDMA, who with outstretched 
arms is trying to catch him. He leaps, picks up a gun from 
Grandma's gun rack and shots it at Grandma, who keeps 
advancing, Ninja-style. Finally, the little boy is 
cornered and killed with hugs and kisses. 
GRANDMA 
(ELECTRONIC VOICE) Game over. 
Bart looks up at the clock. It's 4:21 p.m. 
BART (CONT'D) 
(INSERTING ANOTHER COIN) All right, 
one more hour and we hit the books. 
INT. SIMPSON LIVING ROOM 
SUPER: 5:05 P.M. SFX: TELETYPE 


TIME FLASHES in the corner of the screen as Bart watches 
"The Itchy and Scratchy Show" on television. 


ON TV 
TITLE: "Let Them Eat Scratchy." The setting is Paris, 
France. Scratchy has Itchy hanging upside down off the 
Eiffel Tower, but Itchy gets away. Scratchy chases Itchy 
down the steps only to find himself caught in a guillotine. 
Itchy, now dressed as Napoleon Bonaparte, pulls the cord 
and lops Scratchy's head off. Blood splashes the screen 
red. "The End." Bart SNICKERS at the crazy antics. 
MARGE (0.S.) 
Soup's on! 
BART 
Okay, one more hour and it's down to 
business. 
INT. KITCHEN 
SUPER: 6:10 P.M. SFX: TELETYPE 


The family sits around the table, eating dinner. 


TABLE DRAFT 3/16/90 PAGE 7. 


HOMER 
(CHEWING) Mmmm. Marge, you could cut 
these pork chops with a spoon. 
MARGE 
Thank you, Homer. Lisa, did you tell 
your father your good news? 
HOMER 
What happened? Did you win something? 
LISA 
No, Dad. I got an A on my vocabulary 
test 


She points to the refrigerator. We see it is covered with 
dozens of "A" papers by Lisa. 


HOMER 
Vocabu--what? 
BART 
(OUTRAGED) Hey man, what's the big 
idea? You covered up my paper. 
Bart walks over to the refrigerator and pulls the test off 
the door. We see that it was covering up a yellow, dog- 
eared drawing of a CAT next to a tree -- Bart's sole 
contribution to the door. It is signed "Bart - lst Grade." 
HOMER 
(CHORTLING) Look at those funny little 
whiskers. Almost looks like a cat. 
LISA 
May I please be excused? I have some 


light studying to take care of before 


bed. 


TABLE DRAFT 3/16/90 PAGE 


HOMER 
(SNAPPING FINGERS) Oooo! That reminds 
me. It's Big Gorilla Week on The 
Million Dollar Movie. C'mon boy. 
BART 
No, Dad, I should really... 
INT. LIVING ROOM 
SUPER: 8:05 P.M. SFX: TELETYPE 
Homer TURNS ON the television. A GORILLA is rampaging 
through a city block. He has a couple of people in each 
hand. 
HOMER 
(GASPS) Oh, "Gorilla, The Conqueror." 
The one against which all others are 
judged. 
BART 
(UNEASILY) Well, maybe just one more 
hour. 
INT. LIVING ROOM - 9:35 P.M. 
Bart and Homer sit watching the movie. Homer WEEPS openly. 
In the movie a big gorilla in a cage floats out to the 
middle of the sea. "The End." 
HOMER 
(SNIFFLING, TEARY) It's so unfair... 
just because he's different. 
BART 


Well, time to hit the books. 


TABLE DRAFT 3/16/90 PAGE 9. 


HOMER 
(CHUCKLING) Burning the candle at both 
ends, eh boy? Go get ‘en. 
INT. BART'S ROOM - 9:50 P.M. 
Bart sits on the end of his bed. He rolls up his sleeves, 
does a few "Art Carney" moves, SHARPENS his pencil and 
opens his textbook, which is titled, "Let Freedom Ring." 
BART 
All right, okay, time for a little 
action here, let's take care of some 
business. (READING) "Chapter One: A s

some living in Holland, left Plymouth, 
England. Their destination was -- 
Bart YAWNS and his eyes get droopy. Then, suddenly his 
head SLAMS down on the open book. He's out for the count. 
Homer walks past Bart's room and spots his boy asleep on 
his book. 
HOMER 
Psst... Marge. Come take a look at 
this. 
Marge walks up and looks in, beaming. 
HOMER (CONT'D) 
(PROUD) Boy, if I had half his 


gumption, I'd own my own nuclear plant 


by now. 


TABLE DRAFT 3/16/90 PAGE 


MARGE 
The little tiger tries so hard. Why 
does he keep failing? 

HOMER 
(PICKING BART UP) Just a little dim, I 
guess. 


Homer lays Bart on the bed, takes off his shoes and tucks 
him in. 


INT. BART'S BEDROOM - MORNING 
Bart's asleep. We hear a BUS HORN HONK. 
MARGE (0.S.) 
Bart, honey... you're going to miss 
your bus! 
Bart wakes up, stretches and YAWNS. 
BART 
Good morning woorr-- (SEES TEXTBOOK) -- 
we're in big trouble. 
INT. BUS - MORNING 
Bart and Lisa get on the bus. 
oTTto 
Hey, Bart-dude. You looked freaked. 
BART 
I am, Otto-man. Do you know anything 
about Pilgrims? 
oTTto 


They had cool hats, man.

TABLE DRAFT 3/16/90 PAGE 11. 


BART 
(DISPIRITED) Thanks. (UNDER BREATH) 
Okay, no reason to panic. Find an 
egghead, charm them for a couple of 
answers, boom, we're back on easy 
street. 
Bart spots the twins, SHERRY AND TERRY. 
SHERRY AND TERRY'S POV 
Bart approaching, wearing a politician's smile. 
SHERRY 
(UNDER BREATH) Look at him. I bet he 
aidn't study again. 
TERRY 
And now he's going to try to kiss up 
and get answers from us. 
SHERRY 
He's pathetic. 
SHERRY/TERRY 
Good morning, Bart. 
BART 
Good morning, girls. I don't know 
which one of you looks lovelier. 
SHERRY/TERRY 


She does.

Yeah. 
TERRY 


On Alcatraz rock. 


BART 
Yeah. 

SHERRY 
In 1812. 

BART 
Yeah. 

TERRY 


Which led to a bloody civil war... 
BART 
(PROMPTING) Uh huh, and then... 
The bus comes to a halt in front of the school. 
EXT. SCHOOL 
Kids get off the bus. The twins emerge GIGGLING between 


themselves. Bart gets off, followed by Martin. Martin 
approaches Bart. 


TABLE DRAFT 3/16/90 PAGE 


MARTIN 
As a natural enemy, it perplexes me why 
I offer you this bit of advice. But 
the information pertaining to America's 
colonial period that you just received 
is erroneous. 

BART 
What? So you're saying... 

MARTIN 
A laboratory chimpanzee randomly 
pecking at a typewriter has a better 
chance of passing this test then you 
do. 

BART 
(GROANS) 


The BELL RINGS. Martin enters the school. Bart looks 
nauseous. 


INT. CLASSROOM 


Krabappel hands out the test to the kids in the front rows. 
Krabappel's voice trails off. 


KRABAPPEL BART (V.O) . 
All right, students, take Think, Simpson, think. 
one and pass the rest Crisis brings out the 
back. If you have any best in you. 


trouble, move on to the 


next question. 


After a BEAT.

TABLE DRAFT 3/16/90 PAGE 


BART 
(CLUTCHING STOMACH) Ooooo!! 
KRABAPPEL 
(WEARILY) What is it, Bart? 
BART 
(WEAKLY) Nothing... must... take... 
test. 
Bart crumples to the ground in a heap. 
INT. HALLWAY 
Doubled over in pain, Bart exits his classroom. As soon as 
the door closes, Bart straightens up and walks down the 
hall WHISTLING A MERRY TUNE. We stay with him as he walks 
to the Infirmary. Bart resumes his position of pain as he 
opens the Infirmary door. 


INT. INFIRMARY 


NURSE FARRELL is bent over on the floor retrieving a 
spilled jar of tongue depressors. 


BART 
(STUMBLING FORWARD) Ooooo!! 
NURSE FARRELL 
(ALARMED) What's the matter, son? 
BART 
Sharp, stabbing pains... in my stomach. 
NURSE FARRELL 
Oh dear, I've heard of this. 
She picks up a medical encyclopedia. 
ON ENCYCLOPEDIA 
as the Nurse flips to a page marked "Amoria Phlebitis." 


The first symptom is "Sharp, stabbing pains in the 
stomach." 


14. 


TABLE DRAFT 3/16/90 PAGE 15. 


NURSE 
(READING FROM BOOK) "Do you feel a 
shooting pain in your in your arm?" 
BART 
(NODDING) Both arms. 
NURSE 
"Temporary loss of vision?" 
BART 
Who said that? Come closer. 
Bart puts his hands out as if to feel a face. 
INT. BART'S BEDROOM 


Bart lies in his bed eating ice cream. He rings a BELL and 
Marge appears at the door immediately. 


MARGE 
Yes, dear? 

BART 
(HOLDING OUT EMPTY BOWL) Maybe... one 
more dish. 

MARGE 


(MERRILY) Your third bowl... I think 
you may be on the mend. Is there 
anything else I can get you? 

BART 
Perhaps the Tv? 

MARGE 


Of course. (CALLING OUT) Homer!? 


TABLE DRAFT 3/16/90 PAGE 


INT. LIVING ROOM 


Homer sits in front of another Gorilla Movie. About to 
bite into a thick meat sandwich. 


MARGE (0.S.) 
Bring the television up. Bart's got 
his vision back! 
HOMER 
(ANNOYED GRUNT) 
INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - STAIRWAY 
Homer carries the TV upstairs. 
HOMER (CONT'D) 
(MUTTERING) I wish I had Amoria 
Phlebitis. 
INT. BART'S BEDROOM - LATER 
Bart is watching television. Lisa is there. 
LISA 
Everyone knows you're faking it, Bart. 
BART 
Well, everyone better keep their mouths 
shut. 
LISA 
Well, you're going to have to fail that 
history test sooner or later. 
BART 
I've got my bases covered. 


Bart picks up the phone and DIALS. 


16. 


TABLE DRAFT 3/16/90 PAGE 17. 


BART (CONT'D) 
(ON PHONE) Hey Milhouse, what did I 
miss in school today? 
MILHOUSE (0.S.) 
(OVER PHONE) Nothing much. Lewis made 
Richard laugh milk through his nose. 
BART 
(ON PHONE - NOT VERY INTERESTED) You 
don't say? And what about that history 
test?... (A LITTLE SINISTER) Piece of 
cake, huh? So let me ask you this? 
What did you get for Number one? 
(WRITES IT DOWN) Uh huh. And Number 
two?... Number three?... 
INT. CLASSROOM - DAY 


Bart whips through his make-up exam and turns it into to 
Mrs. Krabappel. 


BART 
(COYLY) Here you go, Mrs. Krabappel. 
I think you'll be pleasantly surprised. 
Krabappel pulls out her red pen and begins to grade it. 
ON TEST 
X. X. X. X. X. Every answer is wrong. 
BACK TO BART 


Bart registers increasing dismay with each wrong answer. 
Finally, Mrs. Krabappel marks a big red "F". 


TABLE DRAFT 3/16/90 PAGE 


KRABAPPEL 
Why, this test is worse than Milhouse's 
exam. Bart Simpson, I warned you. This 
is the final straw! 
Bart GULPS. 
INT. CLASSROOM = NIGHT 


Homer, Marge and Bart sit across the desk from Mrs. 
Krabappel and District Psychiatrist DR. J. LOREN PRYOR. 


KRABAPPEL 
Mr. and Mrs. Simpson, I think you know 
our District Psychiatrist, Mr. J. Loren 
Pryor. 

HOMER 
Hey, Dr. J. 

PRYOR 
I think what we have on our hands here 
is a classic case of what laymen refer 
to as fear of failure. Let me explain. 
Psychologically, Bart never tries; 
therefore, he never fails. 

HOMER 
(NODDING) Hmmm... 

PRYOR 
One of his problems may be his short 
attention span, which can lead to... 

HOMER'S POV 


As Pryor continues to speak. 


1s. 


TABLE DRAFT 3/16/90 PAGE 19. 


PRYOR (PRYOR) 
Blah, blah, blah... (PAUSE) 
HOMER 
You don't say? 
PRYOR 
Blah, blah, blah... (PAUSE) 
HOMER 
I'll be. 


Meanwhile, Krabappel reads through Bart's file, GRUNTING 
repeatedly. Bart shifts uneasily in his seat. 


KRABAPPEL 
Bart has failed his last four exams in 
history. (TO BART) Is there anything 
you're not telling us? 

BART 
(SHRUGGING) No. 

PRYOR 
Every other student in the class has 
shown at least some form of improvement 
and yet you continue to struggle. Why 
is that? 

BART 
Dunno. 

KRABAPPEL 
Look at these results. Fifty-five, 
forty-two, twenty-six... a twelve on 
State capitals... 


Bart cracks. 


TABLE DRAFT 3/16/90 PAGE 20. 


BART 
(WILD EYED) Look, you can't squeeze 
blood from a turnip. Why do you want 
me to say?! I'm dumb, okay? You think 
I'm happy about it? 

MARGE 
There, there, Bart. You're just a late 
bloomer. 

PRYOR 
I wish it was that simple. As shameful 
and emotionally crippling as it may be, 
I'm afraid that my recommendation is 
for Bart Simpson to be held back. 

BART 
What! You can't hold me back. I'll do 
better, I promise. 


Everyone AD LIBS: "Yeah, right," "We've heard that 
before", etc. 


MARGE 
Well, maybe it would help him to be 
left back. It won't be so bad, Bart. 

CLOSE-UP - BART 

BART 
No, I mean it. You can't hold me back. 
I swear I'm gonna do better. Look at 
my eyes. See the sincerity, see the 
conviction, see the fear. As God as my 


witness, I can pass fourth grade.

AcT TWO 
FADE IN: 
INT. SCHOOL BUS - MORNING 
A forlorn Bart explains his predicament to Milhouse. 
BART 
So they told me this was my final 
warning. Absolutely no more chances. 
Either I shape up on the next test or 
they are going to hold me back. 
MILHOUSE 
So? That's what they always say. 
They're bluffing. 
BART 
(CHEWING ON HIS NAILS) No, they really 
mean it this time. What am I gonna do? 
MILHOUSE 
(SHRUGGING) Why don't you spit on 
Martin? That always makes you feel 
better. 
ON MARTIN'S NECK 


as a big, wet spitball slaps against it. Martin turns 
around. 


MARTIN 
I pity you. 
Milhouse LAUGHS. Bart looks forlorn. 
BART 
(BLEAK) It's just not the same 


anymore. 


TABLE DRAFT 3/16/90 PAGE 23. 


INT. BUS - CONTINUOUS 
The bus pulls up at school. Otto opens the doors. 
oTTo 
Get off the bus or forever hold your 
peace, little dudes. 
Bart approaches Otto. 
BART 
Otto, you know I respect you. I mean 
you always let us throw stuff at cars 
and try to tip the bus on sharp 
turns... 
oTTo 
Hey man, I was there myself once. 
What's in your head, little man? 
BART 
(WRINGING HANDS) Well, I've been 
failing a lot of tests recently. 
otto 
(VERY DIM) Yuh huh. 
BART 
And now they tell me that if I don't 
shape up they are going to hold me back 
in the fourth grade. 
otto 
That's it? Hey, relax, man. It's not 


the end of the world. 


TABLE DRAFT 3/16/90 PAGE 


BART 
Really? 
oTTo 
(NODDING) It could end up being the 
best thing that ever happened to you. 
I got held back in the fourth grade 
myself -- twice. And look at me, man. 
(WITH PRIDE) Now I drive the school 
bus. 
Bart's expression sinks. 
EXT. SCHOOLYARD - RECESS 
KIDS play merrily all over the playground. Off ina 
corner, a very pale looking Bart stands alone, throwing a 
ball against a wall. As he throws the ball, we 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. CLASSROOM - THE YEAR 2020 (BART'S FANTASY) 
KRABAPPLE 
All right, class... the topic is World 
Literature. What was the pirate's name 
in Treasure Island? 
A 40-YEAR OLD BART 
sitting in the back of the class, dressed in clothes that 
are ten times to small for him and smoking a cigarette. He 
tries to hide behind the kids sitting in front of him. 
KRABAPPEL 
Bart Simpson? 
BART 


(STUCK) Uh... Blackbeard? 


24. 


TABLE DRAFT 3/16/90 PAGE 25. 


KRABAPPEL 
No. 

BART 
Redbeard? 

KRABAPPEL 
No. 

BART 
Peg Leg Pete? 

KRABAPPEL 


Oh, Bart. It looks like I'll be seeing 
you again next year. 


As the words "again next year" begin to ECHO in Bart's 
head, we: 


DISSOLVE BACK 
TO: 


EXT. SCHOOLYARD - RECESS 
As the ball BOUNCES off Bart's head and rolls over to 
MARTIN PRINCE 
who sits underneath a tree reading "Moby Dick." 
BART 
Little help! 


Martin continues reading. Other kids run up from the field 
to stand beside Bart. 


BART (CONT'D) 
Hey, Martin... are you deaf? I said 
little help! Throw me the ball, 


Poindexter. 


TABLE DRAFT 3/16/90 PAGE 26. 


MARTIN 
I'm sorry, Bart. I wasn't familiar 
with the rules of your sport. I didn't 
want to interfere with a ball in play. 
Martin picks up the ball and throws it back to Bart like a 
girl. All the other kids LAUGH and AD LIB derisive 
comments about how Martin throws. Bart see Martin's 
humiliation. 
MARTIN (CONT'D) 
Well, back to the forecastle of the 
Pequod. 
CLOSE-UP - BART 
his eyes widen as he gets an idea. He approaches Martin. 
BART 
Hey, Martin. 
MARTIN 
You have your ball back. 
I have nothing else to give. 
BART 
I need you to help me get a passing 
grade. 
MARTIN 
Well, you need someone's help to get a 
passing grade but I'm puzzled as to why 
that someone should be me. 
BART 
Because I can teach you how to be 
normal. 


Martin cocks his head like a dog who doesn't understand. 


TABLE DRAFT 3/16/90 PAGE 27. 


MARTIN 
Come again? 
BART 
I mean I'll make it so that the other 
kids don't laugh at you so much. 
MARTIN 
(TAKEN ABACK) They... laugh at me? 
I'd always considered myself rather 
popular. 
BART 
You're not. 
Martin sits down a little stunned by it all. 
MARTIN 
Well, let's give it a try. 
BART 
Then it's a deal. 


Bart extends his hand to shake. As Martin goes to shake, 
Bart pulls his hand away. 


BART (CONT'D) 
Lesson number one. 
INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - STAIRWAY 
Bart and Martin walk up the stairs. 
MARTIN 
All righty, first things first. Let's 
have a look-see at your study area. 
BART 


Study area? 


TABLE DRAFT 3/16/90 PAGE 28. 


MARTIN 
Yes, every child has one. A private 
place, a sanctuary from the hurly-burly 
of modern life, perhaps with a Western 
exposure. 
BART 
Oh, yeah. (OPENS BEDROOM DOOR) I 
guess it would be over there. 
Bart points to a corner where something resembling a desk 
is located. It is covered with candy wrappers, laser guns 
and small boxes of ammunition. Martin shakes his head. 
MARTIN 
Oh, no. This won't do at all. Not one 
bit. First things first. We're going 
to have to clean up this room. 
BART 
What? 
MARTIN 
And we'll clearly have to get a few 
ferns in here. No study area is 
complete without adequate plant-life. 
BART 
Gotcha. 
INT. SCHOOL BUS - DAY 


Bart and Martin walk on the bus. Martin sits down in the 
front seat. Bart grabs him. 


BART 


No. 


TABLE DRAFT 3/16/90 PAGE 


MARTIN 
No? 
BART 
Only geeks sit in the front seat. From 
now on you sit in the back row. 
MARTIN 
Why? 
BART 
Because if you sit in the front, people 
can see the back of your head. You're 
a prime target for paper clips bouncing 
off your skull and spitballs dripping 
down your neck. 
MARTIN 
Ahhh. Very wise. 
Martin and Bart head to the back of the bus. 
MONTAGE: 
MUSIC UP: THEME FROM "BRIAN'S SONG" 
1) BLACKTOP: Bart shows Martin how to pop a wheelie on his 
bike. He also takes the bell and basket off Martin's 
handlebars. 
2) LIBRARY: Martin introduces Bart to the Librarian. 


3) BACKYARD: Martin attempts to shoot spitwads at a row of 
soda bottles. Bart walks behind him and adjusts his ain. 


4) BART'S ROOM: An excited Martin stands before Bart, 
sitting at his squeaky clean study area. Martin pulls a 
large fern from behind his back and hands it to Bart. Bart 
looks less than thrilled.

EXT. SCHOOL - DAY 
The boys (including Milhouse, Lewis, Richard) race around a 
corner, behind a wall, nearly hyperventilating. They have 
clearly done something terribly wrong. Martin is GIGGLING 
nervously. AD LIB, "That was great," "That was funny," 
"Did you see the look on his face?" 
MARTIN 
Who would have thought that pushing a 
boy into the girls' lavatory could be 
such a thrill? The screams, the 
humiliation, the fact that it wasn't 
me. I've never felt so alive. 
BART 
Great, Martin. Now the big test is 
tomorrow. What do you say we... 
MARTIN 
There's a side of me I never knew 
existed, Bart. A dark side. I want to 
live there, Bart. 
BART 
Great, now this test... 
MARTIN 
(RECKLESS ABANDON) Forget about it. 
Life's too short to worry about some 
silly little exan. 
BART 
But... I haven't even started to study 


yet.

TABLE DRAFT 3/16/90 PAGE 31. 


MARTIN 
All these years of study and toil. 
What a tragic waste. 
Martin starts away. 
BART 
Hey, I thought we had a deal. 
MARTIN 
(CHUCKLES) The Martin Prince you made 
a deal with no longer exists. Come on 
boys, to the arcade. 
The other kids AD LIB enthusiasm as they exit. 
ON BART 
a worried expression. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. BART'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 


CLOSE-UP - PICTURE OF GEORGE WASHINGTON CROSSING THE 
DELAWARE 


There are crude drawings of planes strafing Washington. 
Washington with a beard. The Loch Ness Monster. Bart is 
drawing in a shark. 

CUT WIDE 


We see Bart looks bored as he sits in his pajamas reading 
his textbook. Marge sticks her head in. 


MARGE 

Bart, it's past your bedtime. 
BART 

(FLATLY) Okay. 


Bart SLAMS the book shut. 


TABLE DRAFT 3/16/90 PAGE 32. 


BART (CONT'D) 
(TO HIMSELF) This is hopeless. I 
guess if you don't know history you're 
doomed to repeat the fourth grade. 
He SIGHS heavily and looks up at the stars. He crosses to 
the bed, gets down on his knees. Unseen by him, Lisa 
watches from the doorway. 
BART (CONT'D) 
(TO GOD) Well, old timer... I guess 
this is the end of the road. I know I 
haven't been a decent, normal kid. But 
if I have to go to school tomorrow, 
I'll fail the test and be held back. I 
just need one more day to study. I 
need your help. 
LISA 
(TO HERSELF) Prayer, the last refuge 
of a scoundrel. 
BART 
A teacher's strike, a power failure, a 
blizzard. Anything that'll cancel 
school tomorrow. I know it's asking a 
lot, but if anyone can do it, you can. 


Bart sadly gets into bed and lays his head on the pillow.

EXT. OUTSIDE BART'S WINDOW 

As Bart turns out the light, we PULL OUT. After a long 
BEAT, a sole snowflake floats to the ground and lands on 
the lawn. Then, a couple of snowflakes fall. Suddenly 
there's a blizzard. 


FADE OUT.

Bart is asleep in bed. Marge KNOCKS on the door and sticks 
her head in. 


MARGE 
Bart, rise and shine, little guy. 


Bart wakes up. His textbook is propped up prominently in 
f.g. 


BART 
(MERRILY) Good morning, woorr -- (SEES 
BOOK) Oh, no. 
Then his eyes look above the book and widen delightedly. 
BART (CONT'D) 
Hello! 
REVERSE ANGLE 
Snow piled up outside of his window. Bart throws open the 
window and looks around excitedly. He runs downstairs in 
his pajamas. 
INT. KITCHEN. 
The Simpsons are all gathered around the radio. 
MARTY (0.S.)

MARTY (0.S.)

Throughout the following Bart and Homer chant to 
themselves.

C'mon baby. Give it to me. be a lady tonight. Close, 
Close, close, close... close, close...

HOMER 


Whoo hoo!

Marty... 

MARTY (0.S.) 
(ON RADIO) The one you kids have been 
waiting for. Springfield county

excited. 

A DRUMROLL as Bill opens the envelope. 

BILL (0.S.) 
(ON RADIO) Springfield county schools 
will be closed! 

BART 
All right! 


Homer and Bart do the "Icky Shuffle", WHOOPING and 
HOLLERING it up. 


EXT. SPRINGFIELD COUNTY - MORNING 
BIRD'S EYE VIEW 


Thousands of KIDS run into the street SCREAMING WITH JOY. 
Thousands of MOTHERS chase after them carrying scarves and 
hats. 


INT. SIMPSON HALLWAY - MORNING 


Bart busts out of his room, wild-eyed and ready for action. 
He's got his ice skates over his shoulder, ski goggles on 
his head and is carrying his sled over his head like a 
surfboard. 


TABLE DRAFT 3/16/90 PAGE 37. 


BART 
(HEADING DOWNSTAIRS) Cowabunga! Snow's 
up! 
MARGE (0.S.) 
Take a break if your arms go numb! 
LISA 
Stands in Bart's way, looking at him with wonder in her 
eyes. Bart stops in his tracks. A HEAVENLY CHOIR begins 
to SING. 
LISA 
I heard you last night, Bart. You 
prayed for this. Now your prayers have 
been answered. I'm no theologian. I 
don't know who or what God is exactly. 
All I know is He's a force more 
powerful than Mom and Dad put together 
and you owe him big. 


Bart's expression suddenly turns glassy-eyed as he flashes 
back to the night before when he asked for God's help. 


BART 
My God, she's right. What was I 
thinking of? I've asked for a miracle 
and now I've received it. For this I 
will study. Study as I've never 
studied before. 


Lisa grabs the skates and goggles from Bart as he turns 
around and heads back towards his room in a daze. 


INT. BART'S BEDROOM 


Bart waters the fern. Homer enters bundled up for a day in 
the snow. 


TABLE DRAFT 3/16/90 PAGE 38. 


HOMER 
c'mon, boy. It's a winter wonderland 
out there! 
BART 
Sorry, Dad. No can do. 
HOMER 
why? 
BART 
I've made a pact with the Lord. 
HOMER 
Oh, okay. Can I borrow your sled? 
Bart hands Homer the sled and he exits with a YIP. 
BART 
(TO HIMSELF) I'm not missing anything. 
Frozen earlobes, snowballs down the 
back of the neck, trudging up that 
stupid sled hill over and over again... 
how good could it be? 
Bart OPENS his window shade and looks outside. 
EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD 
Exploding with life in every corner. A Currier and Ives 
poster come to life. Huge snowball fights, KIDS building 
forts and snowmen. Everyone is having the time of their 
lives. There are elaborate ice sculptures being built. A 
hockey game is in progress on the frozen pond where Mrs. 
Krabappel throws a body check into PRINCIPAL SKINNER, 
knocking off his wool cap. 
SKINNER

TABLE DRAFT 3/16/90 PAGE 39. 


KRABAPPEL 
(CACKLING) I haven't had this much fun 


in years! 


BURNS walks through wearing a long stripped muffler and a 
top hat. A snowball knocks his hat off. 


HOMER 
(CHUCKLES) 
BURNS 
(GOOD NATURED) Why you young 
ragamuffin. I'll teach you a lesson 
you won't soon forget. Smithers, hit 
him. 
SMITHERS chucks a snowball at Homer. The SPRINGFIELD 
MARCHING BAND walks by PLAYING "Winter Wonderland". 
Makeshift stands are being raised as MAYOR DIAMOND JOE 
QUIMBY steps out of his limosine and walks up to a podiun. 
MAYOR QUIMBY 
I declare this "Snow Day" -- The 
funnest day in the history of 
Springfield! 
The ENTIRE TOWN joins hands and begins to SING.

he watches the spectacle and nervously rubs his chin -- 
like a drunk about to fall off the wagon. His eyes are 
wide as if he's in a trance. 
BART 
Hey! Maybe just one snowball. 
He OPENS the window and is about to step out as he is hit 
in the face with a snowball. Martin approaches packing 
another one. 
MARTIN 
Sorry, Bart. Just being a real kid. 
Milhouse, Richard and Lewis follow behind. 
MILHOUSE 
Great shot, Martin. 
LEWIS 
Right between the eyes. 
RICHARD 


Your arm's really improved. 


Martin turns and starts back up the hill as the boys follow 
after him chanting. 


MILHOUSE/RICHARD/ LEWIS 
Martin! Martin! Martin! 


Bart SLAMS the window shut, grabs his books and heads out 
the door resigned to study. 


INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - BASEMENT 
Bart barricades the door and walks down the steps, carrying 


only his books and a candle to read by. He means business

Bart scribbles a final answer, walks up to her desk and 
hands it over. There is a look of desperation in his eyes. 


BART 
Do you think you could grade it now? 
KRABAPPEL 
Well, I suppose so. I guess next to 
you, I am the one who'll suffer most 
from your repeating fourth grade. 
BART 
Could you just please grade it? 


She pulls out her dreaded red pen. Bart paces behind her 
like an expectant father.

sort of surprised. 
KRABAPPEL 
Bart, what's the matter? I would think 
that you'd be used to failing by now. 
BART

Yeah, well that and a dime will get you

KRABAPPEL 
No, you are actually showing a glimmer

difficulty and relative obscurity of

point on your exam. 
Mrs. Krabappel takes the test back from Bart, crosses out 
the 58 and marks a giant 60 on the top of the paper. It's

ACT ONE 


FADE IN: 
STAGE CURTAIN - COLD OPENING 


Marge steps out from behind a curtain and addresses the 
audience. 


MARGE 
(CLEARING HER THROAT) Hello, everyone. 
You know, Halloween is a very strange 
holiday. Personally, I don't 
understand it. Kids worshiping ghosts, 
pretending to be devils, and things on 
T.V. that are completely inappropriate 
for younger viewers. Things like the 
following half hour. Nothing seems to 
bother my kids, but tonight's show, 
which I totally wash my hands of, is 
really scary, so if you have sensitive 
children, maybe you should tuck them 
into bed early tonight, instead of 
writing us angry letters tomorrow. 


FADE OUT. 


FINAL DELIVERY 5/04/90 2. 


FADE IN: 
EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT 
Short scary version of the Simpsons Main Title. It is 
raining, lightning flashes. THUNDER ROARS. MUSIC: a 
scary, dirge-like, organ version of the Simpsons' theme. A 
BLACK CAT SCREECHES, a shutter BANGS, some RATS scurry. We 
see lit Jack O' Lanterns and candles burning inside 
windows. We go past the Springfield Cemetery, past the 
tombstones (reading: Ishmael Simpson; Ezekiel Simpson; 
Cornelius V. Simpson; Garfield; Elvis; Erwin Rommel, desert 
fox and loving husband) through to the Simpsons’ house. 
There is a dilapidated tree house in one of the scary 
trees. Lamplight glows from within. We see a big ghost 
walking up tothe treehouse. He pulls off his hood and we 
see it's HOMER in a sheet. He looks into a big paper bag 
he is carrying, shakes it, and we hear RUSTLING of tons of 
candy. 
HOMER 

(TO HIMSELF) Oooo! What a haul ths 

year. I love Halloween. 
We see Homer look up at the treehouse. 

HOMER 

Heh, heh. Wait a minute. Let's see 

what the kids are up to. 
He climbs up the ladder. We PULL IN on the tree house. 
CLOSE ON - TREE HOUSE 


Bart, Lisa and Maggie sit on the ground, Indian style. 
Lisa is holding a flashlight under her face. 


LISA 
++. and the policeman on the other end 
of the phone said, "We have traced the 
call. It is coming from the floor 
below you. Get out of the house!" But 


it was too late. End of story. 


FINAL DELIVERY 5/04/90 3. 


BART 
Yawn. I heard that when I was in the 


third grade. It's not scary. 


LISA 
Is too. 

BART 
Is not. 

LISA 
Is too. 

BART 
Is not. 

LISA 
Is too. 

BART 
Is not. 

LISA 


Fine. Then you tell one scarier. 
BART 
Flashlight, please. 
Lisa hands Bart the flashlight. 
BART (CONT'D) 
Here's a story that's really 
scarifying. 
LISA 
Oh, brother. 
BART 


I call it (LAUGH) "Bad Dream House." 


FINAL DELIVERY 5/04/90 4. 


Simultaneously, lightning flashes, thunder RUMBLES, and we 


SUPERIMPOSE: “BAD DREAM HOUSE" IN SCARY, DRIPPING BLOOD 
LETTERING 


DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. HUGE OLD HOUSE LIKE IN "THE SHINING" = DUSK 
Moving vans are parked out front. Moving MEN are bringing 
empty dollies out of the house and putting them back in the 
vans. 
INT. LIVING ROOM OP HOUSE 
The furniture is in place but some pieces are still 
covered. There are boxes scattered around the room. HOMER 
and MARGE are watching the last of the boxes being 
unloaded. BART, LISA and MAGGIE are starting to open the 
boxes and unpack them. 
MOVING MAN 
That's all of it. Sign here. 


Homer takes a clipboard from the moving man, signs the top 
sheet of paper and hands it back, along with a dollar. 


HOMER 
(GRANDLY) There you are, my man. And 
a dollar for yourself. 


The moving man takes the dollar, looks at it briefly, gives 
Homer a long searching look. 


MOVING MAN 
A buck! I'm glad there's a curse on 
this place. 
Moving Man exits. 
HOMER 
Huh? (TO FAMILY - SURVEYING THE ROOM) 


Well... it's all ours! 


FINAL DELIVERY 5/04/90 5. 


MARGE 
I still can't believe how inexpensive 
it was. 
HOMER 
Motivated seller, Marge. 
MARGE 
Well, he certainly must have been 
motivated. Prime location, eighteen 
bedrooms, moat... we shouldn't be able 
to afford this. 
HOMER 
So we got a good deal for once. Quit 
fighting it. 
MARGE 
It just seems too good to be true. 
Unseen by the family, some of the unpacked items begin 
repacking themselves. Low WEIRD MUSIC accompanies this. 
Marge opens a box, takes out some pots and pans and begin 
taking them into the kitchen. A book suddenly flies off 
the coffee table, SOARS across the room and HITS Lisa in 
the back of the neck. 
LISA 


Ow! Mom! Bart threw a magazine at me. 


BART 
Did not. 

LISA 
Did too. 

BART 


Did not. 


FINAL DELIVERY 5/04/90 6. 


LISA 
Did too. 
HOUSE (0.S.) 
(DEEP MENACING VOICE) Get out! 
Everyone stops what they're doing and look around. 
MARGE 
What on earth was that? 
HOMER 
(GUESSING) Oh, just the house 
settling. 
MARGE 
(UNSATISFIED MURMUR) 
Marge carries her load of pots and pans into the kitchen as 
everyone else goes back to unpacking. The unpacked items 
are being replaced faster now. 
INT. KITCHEN 
Marge enters the kitchen and sets down the pots and pans. 
Blood is rolling down the walls of the otherwise cheery 
kitchen. 
MARGE 
(TO HERSELF) Hmmm. This kitchen 
certainly could use a woman's touch. 
In the corner she sees a SWIRLING orange-green vortex. 
MARGE (CONT'D) 
(CALLING) Homer! What's this thing in 
the corner? 


Homer ambles in, followed by Lisa. They both look at the 
vortex. 


FINAL DELIVERY 5/04/90 7. 


HOMER 
Hmmm. Probably some kind of garbage 
disposal. 
LISA 
It looks like a vortex -- a gateway 
into another dimension. 
HOMER 
(DRYLY) Yeah, right. (LOOKS AT 
VORTEX) I wonder if it works. 
Homer takes an orange out of a bag of groceries and tosses 
it underhand into the vortex. The orange seems to stop in 
mid-air when it reaches the vortex, then, accompanied by 
SOFT WEIRD MUSIC it stretches out until it is a horizontal 
line, rotates until it is a vertical line, closes up like a 
tape measure and vanishes. 
HOMER (CONT'D) 
Hey! Pretty slick! 
With a vaguely WEIRD COUGHING SOUND, a small note comes out 
of the vortex and PLOPS onto the kitchen floor. Lisa picks 
it up curiously and reads it aloud. 
LISA 
(READING) "Quit throwing your garbage 
into our dimension." 
Before anyone can comment on this, there is a terrific 
amount of CRASHING and WHIRLING noise coming from the 
living room. 
BART (0.S.) 


Mom! Dad! Help! 


FINAL DELIVERY 5/04/90 8. 


INT. LIVING ROOM 
Marge, Homer and Lisa enter and stop dead in their tracks 
in amazement. Bart is backed up in a corner of the room. 
A lamp cord is floating in the air and has twisted itself 
around his neck. Blood is pouring down the walls, objects 
are flying out of their boxes and SMASHING around Bart's 
head. The doors are slowly BUCKLING in and out as if the 
house were breathing. Maggie GIGGLES as she floats through 
the air. 
HOUSE (0.S.) 
(SLOWLY, MORE MENACING) Get... Out!!! 
HOMER 
Okay boy, let's see you talk yourself 
out of this one. 
Homer untangles Bart, while Marge catches Maggie. Lisa is 
standing quietly in the middle of the room, shivering a 
little. 
LISA 
(QUIETLY) I can feel an evil presence 
in this house. 
MARGE 
Evil! 
HOMER 
Quiet, Lisa. You're scaring your 
mother. 
MARGE 
Children, get your coats. We're 


leaving this house right now. 


The family's coats float through the air to them and the 
front door opens invitingly. 


FINAL DELIVERY 5/04/90 9. 


HOMER 
Now wait a minute, Marge. It's only 
natural there would be some things 
wrong with an old house like this. 
It's a fixer-uper. What's the problem? 
we get a bunch of priests in here... 
MARGE 
I'm not going to live in a house of 
evil just to save a few dollars. 
HOMER 
(GENUINELY OUTRAGED) Don't be so 
stubborn! We're not talking about a 
few dollars! We're talking about a few 
thousand dollars! 


Homer SCREAMS as he is violently levitated upwards to the 
top of the ceiling. 


HOMER (CONT'D) 
It's got great high ceilings, and, oh, 
Marge, look at the beautiful 
craftmanship on these moldings. 
Homer SCREAMS as he drops to the ground with a THUD. 
HOMER (CONT'D) 
(GASPING) Tell you what -- let's sleep 
on it. Okay? 
MARGE 
All right. But if anything happens... 
HOMER 


What could happen? 


FINAL DELIVERY 5/04/90 10. 


MARGE 
(UNCONVINCED MURMUR) 
INT. BART'S ROOM - THAT NIGHT 
Bart is laying in bed nervously listening. 
HOUSE (0.S.) 
They are all against you, Bart. You 
must kill them all. They all must die. 
BART 
Are you my conscience? 
HOUSE (0.S.) 
(BEAT) I... yes, I am. 
INT. LISA'S ROOM 


Lisa is slowly rising from her bed like a possessed person. 
She looks like one of the kids in "The Shining." 


HOUSE (0.S.) 
(SING-SONGY) Liiii-saaa! Liii-saaa! 
The butcher knife, Lisa. 


Lisa takes a butcher knife out of the chest of drawers and 
tests its edge with her finger. 


INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY 
Homer comes out of his bedroom and begins walking slowly 
down the stairs. He is carrying an axe and looks like Jack 
Nicholson in "The Shining." 
HOMER 
(EVIL, TO HIMSELF) They are all 
against me! They all must die! 


INT. MAGGIE'S ROOM 


Maggie is sitting up in her crib, her head slowly spinning, 
SUCKING insanely on her pacifier. 


FINAL DELIVERY 5/04/90 11. 


INT. KITCHEN 


Marge selects the largest carving knife out of a knife rack 
and turns to camera. 


INT. LIVING ROOM 


Homer is heading for the kitchen, his axe raised over his 
head. 


HOMER 
(SING-SONGY) Marge! Oh, Marge! 
MARGE (0.S.) 
(SING-SONGY) I'm in the kitchen, 
Homer! 
Homer hears a NOISE. Bart, Lisa and Maggie are all making 
their way across the hallway. Bart has a meat cleaver in 
his hand. Lisa is following him with a butcher knife. 
Maggie is crawling down after them, a penknife between her 
teeth like a baby pirate. Homer turns and begins stalking 
them. The four of them begin slowly circling each other. 
CLOSE-UP - BART'S FACE AND RAISED MEAT CLEAVER 
CLOSE-UP - LISA'S FACE AND RAISED BUTCHER KNIFE 
CLOSE-UP - MAGGIE'S FACE AND RAISED PEN KNIFE 
CLOSE-UP - HOMER'S FACE AND RAISED AXE 
CLOSE-UP = MARGE'S FACE AND RAISED CARVING KNIFE 
Marge strikes first, bringing the knife down savagely. 


CUT WIDE 


to show we are in kitchen and Marge is spreading mayonnaise 
on her bologna sandwich. 


HOMER, BART, LISA, MAGGIE (0.S.) 
(ALL CACKLE INSANELY) 
Marge looks in the direction of the cackles. 
INT. LIVING ROOM 


Marge enters, eating her sandwich, just as the others are 
about to strike. 


FINAL DELIVERY 5/04/90 12. 


HOUSE (0.S.) 
Diel Die! Everybody die! 
MARGE 
(SHOCKED) What's going on out here? 
Homer! Bart! Lisa! Maggie! Stop it! 
All four stop, turn to look at her. After a few seconds 
their faces relax and they look normal again. They look 
sheepishly at each other. 
HOMER, BART, LISA 
(TO EACH OTHER) Sorry... sorry, mom... 
sorry Maggie... sorry Lisa. 
HOMER, BART, LISA 
(TO EACH OTHER) That's okay. 
MARGE 
That does it. Children, get dressed. 
We're leaving. 
HOMER 
Aw, come on, Marge. You said you'd 
sleep on it. I don't care what I said. 
This family has had its differences, 
and we've squabbled, but we never had 
knife fights before... and I blame this 
house. 


Lisa curiously opens what looks like a closet door and 
peers in. 


LISA 


Mom! Dad! Look! 


FINAL DELIVERY 5/04/90 13. 


LISA'S POV 
There are steps leading down into the basement. The whole 
basement is filled with gravestones that say "Cochise", 
"Geronimo", "Sitting Bull", "Sacajawea", "Hiawatha" and 
"Pocahontas". 
LISA (0.S.) 
(HUSHED) It's an ancient Indian burial 
ground. 
BART (0.S.) 
Man, this place has got everything! 
HOMER (0.S.) 
(OUTRAGED) An ancient Indian what...? 
NEW ANGLE 
Homer strikes to the phone, DIALS. 
HOMER 
(INTO PHONE - SCREAMING) Mr. Ploot? 
Homer Simpson here. When you sold me 
this house you forgot to mention one 
little thing. You didn't you tell me 
it was built on an Indian burial 
ground. (BEAT - SCREAMS) No you 
didn't! (BEAT - SCREAMS) That's not ny 
recollection... (BEAT, THEN BACKING 
DOWN) Yeah! Well... all right, 
goodbye. (HANGS UP PHONE) He says he 
mentioned it five or six times. 
MARGE 


Let's go, children. 


FINAL DELIVERY 5/04/90 14. 


HOMER 
AW, GEE, MARGE. MARGE 
(FIRMLY) Homer... 
HOUSE (0.S.) 
You will die, you will die slowly. 
Your stomach will swell, yourintestines 
will writhe and boil, your eyes will 
burst; and some horrible stuff, 
possibly yur brains, will start coming 
out through your nose... 
Marge is (MURMURING) through all the above dialogue. 
MARGE 
(INTERRUPTING) Shush! 
HOUSE 
Oh, you too will die a horrible 
death... 
MARGE 
(SCREAMING) Shut up! Quit trying to 
push us around. Stop saying those 
horrible things and show some manners. 
HOUSE (0.S.) 
(STUNNED SILENCE. LIGHT BREATHING) 
Bart is staring at one of the walls with rapt interest. 
MARGE 
(TO HOMER) Look at me. I've never 


been so angry. My hands are shaking. 


FINAL DELIVERY 5/04/90 15. 


HOMER 
Better than your eyes bursting. Ewww! 
BART 
(TO HOUSE) Do it again. 
HOUSE (0.S.) 
What? 
BART 
Make the walls bleed. 
HOUSE (0.S.) 
No. 
BART 
Hey, man. We own you. Let's see some 
blood. 
HOUSE (0.S.) 
I don't have to entertain you. 
BART 
Come on man, do it! Do the blood 
thing! Come on, do it! Do it! Do it! 
Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! 
Lisa is talking to another wall in the house. 
LISA 
Why are you trying to scare us? Are 
you trying to keep us from getting 
close to you... maybe even loving you? 
HOUSE (0.S.) 


Leave me alone. 


FINAL DELIVERY 5/04/90 16. 


MARGE 
Don't talk to her like that. 
HOUSE (0.S.) 
Hey, listen lady... 
MARGE 
Oh, don't call me lady. My name is 
Marge Simpson, this is my family and 
we're not going anywhere. We're all 
going to have to live together, so you 
better get used to it... please. 
HOUSE (0.S.) 
Can I have a minute to think about 
this? 
The front door opens. The Simpsons step out of the house. 
EXT. SIMPSON HOUSE 
HOUSE (0.S.) 
Hmmm. Life with the Simpsons. What 
choice do I have> 


House folds in on itself and EXPLODES 


HOMER 
Wow! 

BART 
Bitchin'! 

LISA 


It chose to destroy itself rather than 
live with us. You can't help but feel 


a little rejected. 


FINAL DELIVERY 5/04/90 17. 


The Simpsons turn and leave. We see spurts of flames 
behind them.

That wasn't scary at all, Bart. 
Bart holds up small jewelry box. 
BART 
Oh, yeah? Well how about... 


Bart opens the jewelry box revealing a bloody finger on a 
pad of cotton. 


BART (CONT'D) 
«+. this severed finger! 


Maggie promptly removes her pacifier and pops the severed 
finger into her mouth. Bart snatches the finger back. 


BART (CONT'D) 
Eww, ewww, baby spit. 
LISA 
Heh... heh... heh. 
BART 
Well that last story was just a warm-up 
for this (MISPRONOUNCING) macabre tale,

EXT. SIMPSON BACKYARD - NIGHT 
Homer, Marge, Maggie, Lisa, and Bart are in the back yard 
having a lovely summer barbecue. It is that special time 
of the evening just after sunset, where the stars are just 
beginning to peek out of the sky. The kids are playing tag 
on the lawn. Marge is setting a pretty wooden table while 
Homer sets up the portable barbecue. He wears an apron that 
says "Mafia Staff Apron." Flies BUZZ around the raw meat, 
Homer, Marge and everything else. 
MARGE 
Homer, all these flies. 
HOMER 
Not to worry. I'll just turn on the 
trusty bug zapper. 
Homer turns on the bug zapper. Immediately there are many 
tiny ZAPS8 heard, followed by a long loud ZAP, a long tiny 
SCREAM, then a THUD.. 
HOMER (CONT'D) 
Oooo! That was a big mama. Heh, heh. 


Homer douses the charcoal with lighter fluid. He empties 
the can, and throws it aside. 


HOMER (CONT'D) 

That should just about do it. Man 

alive, there's nothing better than a 

hamburger grilled to perfection... 
Homer strikes a match and throws it into the barbecue. 
LONG SHOT - CITY OF SPRINGFIELD 
In the peaceful twilight of Springfield, suddenly a large 
column of flame rises hundreds of feet into the air from 
the imperceptibly small Simpsons' house. The flame shrinks 
away as fast as it came. 
EXT. SIMPSON BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS 

BART 


Cool man! 


FINAL DELIVERY 5/04/90 20. 


PAN to Lisa who is lying in the grass with a stalk of grass 
in her mouth. We hear an ominous HUM. Lisa looks up. 

Over Bart's head we see the ominous rolling clouds that 
encircle the sky a la Close Encounters. Bright lights, 
almost like stars, twinkle in the sky, but three of these 
lights move in rigid precision. 


DOLLY - UP/ZOOM - OUT (SPIELBERG TRADE MARK SHOT) ON LISA 


Lisa is bathed in a bright white light, and her mouth is 
open in wonderment. One by one the family joins her 
looking up in open mouth wonderment. After a beat, Homer 
joins them with a burger in his mouth. 


HOMER 
The burgers are getting cold, guys. 
(LOOKING UP) Holy moly. 


Homer, stunned, unconsciously takes another bite of his 
burger. There is barbecue sauce on his chin. Suddenly a 
tractor beam hooks on to Lisa. She SCREAMS as it pulls her 
up into the ship. The beam quickly gets Bart, who SCREAMS, 
Maggie, then Marge, who also SCREAMS. The beam starts to 
lift Homer but stalls. The beam starts to lift Homer but 
stalls. The beam repeats this action. Then a second beam 
hooks on to him and struggles to lift him into the ship. 
The ship takes off. 


INT. SPACE CRAFT - TIME IS RELATIVE 


The frightened Simpson family huddles together in a corner 
of a barren steel room. Suddenly, a steel door rises up 
and reveals an ALIEN with blue/green skin and black 
blotches. The alien is nine feet tall, and it's head 
composes half it's body. It has a large gaping mouth with 
very sharp teeth, three noses, and one giant eye, heavily 
lidded, in the middle of his head. It wears a large see 
through helmet, and slithers out on it's many tentacles 
leaving a trail of ooze whereever it goes. The aliens 
constantly drool in the presence of humans. The Simpsons 
STUTTER petrified in horror.

You... you speak English. 

KANG 
I am actually speaking Rigelian. By an 
astonishing coincidence, both of our 
languages are exactly the same. 

BART 
Well, what are you gonna do with us, 
man? 

KANG 
Kodos (INDICATES OTHER ALIEN) and I are 
taking you to Rigel Four. A world of 
infinite delights to tantalize your 
senses and challenge your itellectual 
limitations... 

LISA 
Look, I know that to you we Simpsons 
are a lower order of life. We face 
that prejudice every day of our lives, 
but we are happy on our little planet. 
We throw ourselves on your mercy. 
Please return us to... 

HOMER 
Hey! Get a load of that spread. 

Kang CLAPS his tentacles. SERAK THE PREPARER enters 


pushing a floating food tray which is laden with such a 
spread. 


FINAL DELIVERY 5/04/90 22. 


SERAK THE PREPARER 
Here you go, earthlings. Take all you 
want but eat all you take. 
MARGE 
Well, thank you very much, Mr....? 
SERAK THE PREPARER 
To pronouce it correctly, I would have 
to pull out your tongue. 
MARGE 
Ewww. 
The Simpsons start to eat. 
LISA 
Fried shrimp. 
HOMER 
Smothered pork chops. 
BART 
Sloppy Joes! 
MARGE 
(GASPS) Look, Homer! Radish rosettes. 
These are hard to make. They area 
very advanced race. 
KANG 
Come Earthlings, eat. Grow large with 
food. 


The Simpsons chow down. 


FINAL DELIVERY 5/04/90 23. 


LISA 
There's something not quite right about 
this. 

HOMER 
The girl's right. Let's get some 
applesauce out here for these pork 
chops. 


The aliens scramble to get some applesauce as the Simpsons 
begin shoveling in the food. 


HOMER 
What are you lookin’ at, buddy? 
SERAK THE PREPARER 
Your wife is quite a... dish. 
HOMER 
(PLEASED) Oooh, thanks.

An unhappy Lisa Simpson stares out on to the beautiful 
expanse of space. Saturn and its moons are prominent in 
the view. PAN over to the rest of the Simpsons watching a 
wall-size television. 
KANG 
It's our great pleasure to provide you 
with unlimited entertainment on your 
intergalactic journey. On this cable

BART 
Do you get HBO? 
KANG 
No, that would cost extra. 
Kang walks the family over to an oversized video screen. 
There is a control board with two knobs. We HEAR the game 
being played.

And over here is our crowning 
achievement in amusement technology. 
An electronic version of what you call 
table tennis. Your primitive paddles 
have been replaced by an electronic... 
BART 
(DISGUSTED) Hey, that's just Pong! 
Get with the times, man. 
HOMER 
Marge and I played that old game before 
we were married. 
KANG 
(DEFENSIVELY) Well, we did build this 
space ship, you know? 
KODOS 
Anyone from a species that has mastered 
intergalactic travel, raise your hand. 


All the aliens raise a tentacle while the Simpsons look 
sheepish.

All right, then.

(APOLOGETIC) Sorry. Your game is very 
nice. 


A pleasant TONE sounds and Serak the Preparer and Kodos 
rolls out a futuristic, scientific, floating food tray. 


KODOS 
Dinner time. 
LISA 
Hey, how come we never see you guys 
eat? 
KANG 
(OMINOUSLY) Oh, we wouldn't want to 
spoil our appetite for... the great 
feast when we land on Rigel Four. 
HOMER 
Oooh, a feast. 
MARGE 
Will we be invited? 
KANG 
(ARCHLY) Oh, you'll be at the feast. I 
have a feeling you'll be the guests of 
honor. 
The aliens SNICKER. 
HOMER 
Tell us more about this feast. 
KANG 


No, no, eat now,

When we arrive, there will be plenty of

Other aliens LAUGH insidiously.

INT. SPACE SHIP - LATER 
Several slobbering aliens are observing as the Simpsons 
step up to a giant scale with alien measurements on it. 
Bart steps up and sends a neddle bouncing up the scale. 
KANG 
Very good, earth boy. 
The aliens MURMUR. Homer steps up to the scale and sends 
the needle reeling. All the aliens start to drool 
uncontrollably and express great joy. 
KANG (CONT'D) 
Excellent, Mr. Simpson. Excellent. 
INT. SPACE SHIP - HALLWAY 
Lisa scurries down space ship walkway suspiciously peering 
into many doorways she passes until she stops when comes 
upon a futuristic kitchen. 
INT. SPACESHIP GALLEY = CONTINUOUS 
Lisa peers in. She sees the many hands of Serak The 
Preparer putting the final touches into a pot of sauce. He 
keeps referring to a large book with one of his tentacles. 
SERAK THE PREPARER 
(ARCH) This will give the humans the 
perfect flavor. 
He shuts the book, licks his razor sharp teeth, and drools 
as he takes the sauce away. Lisa, left alone, runs up to 


the book and reads the title: "HOW TO COOK HUMANS." 
Suddenly a horrified look comes over Lisa.

INT. SPACE SHIP - LATER 
Homer, Bart, Marge, and Maggie are about to dig into a 
large bowl off spaghetti with loaves of fresh steaming 
garlic bread and a jug of wine. An alien is off to the 
side PLAYING a MANDOLIN. Kang and Serak The Preparer look 
on with drooling anticipation when Lisa runs in screaming. 
LISA 
Stop! 
The Simpsons drop their forks. The alien STOPS PLAYING. 
LISA (CONT'D) 
Don't you see what's happening here? 
They're fattening us up so they can eat 
us. 
The Simpsons (except Lisa) AD LIB: "Don't be ridiculous," 
"Lisa, you and your imagination," "What are you talking 
about?" 
LISA (CONT'D) 
If you don't believe me, look at this 
book I found. 
The family quickly glances up at the book. 
HOMER 
(GASPS) Doh! Marge, she's right. 
Kang walks in. 
KANG 
(CONCERNED) Humans, you have stopped 
eating. 
HOMER 


Listen, you big stupid space creature. 


Nobody, but nobody eats the Simpsons. 


FINAL DELIVERY 5/04/90 28. 


KANG 
I beg your pardon. 
HOMER 
Don't play dumb with me. We found your 
book. 
KANG 
You mean this? (HOLDS UP BOOK) It's a 
harmless cookbook. It's just a little 
dusty. 
Kang grabs the book and blows off some dust revealing the 
title: "HOW TO COOK FOR HUMANS." The Simpsons are 
relieved. 
LISA 


Wait a minute! 


Lisa runs up to the book and blows some more dust off the 
book, revealing a newer title: "HOW TO COOK FORTY HUMANS." 


LISA (CONT'D) 
Aha! 
The Simpsons react in horror again. 
KANG 
Wait, there's still more space dust on 
here. 


Kang blows off the last bit of dust to reveal the actual 
title: "HOW TO COOK FOR FORTY HUMANS." 


KANG 
(UTTER DISBELIEF) Let me get this 


straight. You thought...

KODOS 
(ANGRY) They thought we were going to 
eat then. 

KANG 
(APPALLED) Good God! Is this some 
kind of joke? 

KODOS 
No, they're serious... 

LISA 
Well, why were you trying to make us 
eat all the time? 

KANG 
Make you eat? We merely provided a 
sumptuous banquet and, frankly, you 
people made pigs of yourself. 

SERAK THE PREPARER 
I slaved in the kitchen for days for 
you people and... 


Serak the Preparer breaks down into TEARS. Kang comforts 
him with two of his tentacles. 


KANG 
(SARCASTIC) Well, if you wanted to 
make Serak the Preparer cry, mission 
accomplished. 

SERAK THE PREPARER

beings who have emotions you know.

EXT. SIMPSON HOUSE - BACKYARD 


The spaceship quickly lands. The hatch pops open. The 
Simpsons and the alieans gather in the doorway. 


KANG 
We offered you paradise. You would 
have experienced emotions a hundred 
times greater than what you call love, 
and a thousand times greater than what 
you call fun. You would have been 
treated like gods and lived forever in 
beauty. But, now because of your 
distrustful nature, that can never be. 
MARGE 
(MURMURS) For a superior race, they 
really rub it in. 
Homer sticks out his hand to shake. 
HOMER 
What do you say, no hard feelings? 
SERAK THE PREPARER 
(BITTERLY) Are you sure you want to 
give me your hand? I might eat it. 
KANG 
Good riddance, humans. 
The Simpsons are pushed out the hatch. The aliens slither 
into the ship and the hatch closes. We see the spaceship 
as it floats off into the far reaches of space. 
LISA 
There were monsters on that ship. And 


truly we were them.

Bart is standing half in, half out of the doorway of the 
treehouse. A hand from outside the treehouse seems to be 
strangling Bart. Bart is making STRANGLING noises. He 
gets no response. 
BART 
Hello, something scary happening. 
Still no response. Makes more STRANGLING noises. 
BART (CONT'D) 
Hey, Poindexter. It's Halloween, put 


the book away. 


Again, no response. Bart stops strangling himself and 
crosses over to Lisa who is thumbing through a book. 


LISA 
For your information, I'm about to read 
you a classic tale of terror by Edgar 
Allan Poe. 
BART 
Wait a minute. That's a schoolbook.

INT. CHAMBER - NIGHT 
Homer, in a velvet smoking jacket and slippers is reading 
at a large antique desk. His book is illuminated by a 
kerosene lamp. A dying fire in the hearth throws long, 
flickering SHADOWS around the room. During the following 
speech, Homer nods off hitting the book with a THUD! 
LISA 
Once upon a midnight dreary, 
LISA/V.0O. 
while I pondered, weak and weary, 
v.o. 
Over many a quaint and curious volume 
ef forgotten lore -- While I nodded, 
nearly napping, suddenly there came a 
tapping, 
We hear a TAP. Homer awakes with a start. 
HOMER 
Huh? 
v.o. 
As of someone gently rapping, rapping 
at my chamber door. 
HOMER 
(DISMISSING) 'Tis some visitor, 
v.o. 
I muttered, 
HOMER 
-- tapping at my chamber door -- Only 
this and nothing more. 


Homer looks around suspiciously. 


33. 


FINAL DELIVERY 5/04/90 


v.O. 

Ah, distinctly I remember. It was in 

the bleak December, And each separate 

dying ember wrought its ghost upon the 

floor. Eagerly I wished the morrow; -- 

vainly I had sought to borrow from my 

books surcease of sorrow: 
Homer SNIFFS sadly. Following his look, we PAN OVER to a 
portrait of "Lenore" (who looks like Marge) in a gilded 
frame. We PAN UP the portrait revealing that Lenore has a 
lot of hair, in fact the portrait is three feet wide and 
twelve feet tall to accommodate it. 


BACK TO HOMER 


He wipes away a tear. 


HOMER 
Oh, Lenore. 
v.0. 
-- sorrow for the lost Lenore -- For 


the rare and radiant maiden whom the 
angels name Lenore -- Nameless here for 
evermore. 
The curtains behind Homer slowly OPEN. 
HOMER 
Aag! 


Homer dives under the desk. 


34. 


FINAL DELIVERY 5/04/90 35. 


v.0. 
And the silken sad uncertain rustling 
of each purple curtain thrilled me -- 
filled me with fantastic terrors never 
felt before; So that now, to still the 
beating of my heart, I stood repeating; 
HOMER 
(TERRIFIED, CHANTING RAPIDLY) 'Tis 
some visitor entreating entrance at my 
chamber door -- This it is and nothing 
more. 
v.o. 
Presently my soul grew stronger; 
hesitating then no longer; 
Still frightened, Homer crosses on tiptoe to the door. 
HOMER 
(NERVOUSLY AND OBSEQUIOUSLY) Sir -- 
v.O. 
-- said I -- 
HOMER 
-- or Madam, truly your forgiveness I 
implore; But the fact is I was napping, 
and so gently you came rapping, And so 
faintly you came tapping, tapping at my 
chamber door, That I scarce was sure I 


heard you. 


FINAL DELIVERY 5/04/90 36. 


v.0. 
Here I opened wide the door; -- 
Homer THROWS OPEN the door. Immediately he MOANS and 
covers his eyes. After a beat, he peeks through his 
fingers. 
HOMER'S POV 
There's nothing there. 
v.0. (CONT'D) 
Darkness there and nothing more. 
Homer SLAMS the door shut and turns back inside. 
V.0. (CONT'D) 
Back into the chamber turning, all my 
soul within me burning, Soon again I 
heard a tapping something louder than 
before. 
We HEAR a series of BOOMING THUDS. Homer's eyes widen. 
HOMER 
(SHRIEKS) Surely -- 
v.O. 
-~- said I -- 
HOMER 
-- surely that is something at ny 
window lattice; Let me see, then, what 
thereat is, and this mystery explore -- 
'Tis the wind and nothing more. 
Homer FLINGS OPEN the window. A RAVEN with an uncanny 


resemblance to Bart in appearance and voice and size, is 
there. Homer's nervous expression turns to confusion. 


FINAL DELIVERY 5/04/90 37. 


HOMER 
Wha--? 


The Raven blinks twice, then jauntily struts in and hops up 
onto a bust of Pallas just above the chamber door. 


v.o. 
Open here I flung the shutter, when, 
with many a flirt and flutter, In there 
stepped a stately Raven of the saintly 
days of yore. Not the least obeisance 
made he; not a minute stopped or stayed 
he, But, with mien of lord or lady, 
perched above my chamber door -- 
Perched upon a bust of Pallas just 
above my chamber door -- Perched, and 
sat, and nothing more. 

Homer and the Raven exchange looks. Homer smiles. 

V.0. (CONT'D) 
Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad 
fancy into smiling, By the grave and 
stern decorum of the countenance it 
wore, 

HOMER 
(CHUCKLES, THEN FRIENDLY) Though thy 
crest be shorn and shaven, thou -- 

v.O. 


I said -- 


FINAL DELIVERY 5/04/90 38. 


HOMER 
-- art sure no craven, Ghastly grim and 
ancient Raven wandering from the 
Nightly shore -- Tell me... tell me 
what thy lordly name is on the Night's 
Plutonian shore! 
v.0. 
Quoth the Raven, 
RAVEN 
Nevermore. 
Homer SCREAMS again. He looks around, then does a double 
take as he realizes the bird has spoken. Homer SNIFFS as 
the room gets smoky. In the b.g-, unseen by Homer, some 
Seraphim (who resemble Lisa and Maggie) cross through 
quickly. They are swinging a censer. SFX: SUCKING. 
v.O. 
Then, methought, the air grew denser, 
perfumed by some unseen censer, Swung 
by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on 
the tufted floor. 
HOMER 
(PLEADING) Wretch -- 
vV.0. 
I cried -- 
HOMER 
-- thy God hath lent thee -- by these 
angels he hath sent thee. (GETTING

(CORRECTING) Nepenthe. 

HOMER 
Huh?

Nepenthe -- in Greek mythology, a drug 
thought to cure sorrow. 

HOMER 
Oh, okay. Respite and nepenthe from 
thy memories of Lenore! Quaff, oh 
quaff this kind nepenthe and forget 
this lost Lenore!

Get thee back into the tempest and the

unbroken! -- quit the bust above my 
door! Take thy beak from out my heart, 
and take thy form from off my door! 
v.o. 
Quoth the Raven, 
RAVEN 
Nevermore. 
HOMER 
Why you little --! 
Homer grabs for the Raven, who bolts from his perch. He 
chases the Raven around the desk. He leaps for the Raven, 
misses, and lands on the rolling cushioned seat. His 
momentum rolls him into a wall of bookshelves which he 
hits, head first with a loud THUD. One by one books drop 
from the shelves hitting Homer's head with accompanying 
“OQUCHES". Finally he slides off the chair onto the floor. 
CLOSE-UP - RAVEN 
We slowly PULL OUT and DROP DOWN to Homer, lying amid the 


books on the floor in the Raven's shadow. He is staring 
vacantly up at the ceiling, damned.

v.Oo. 

And the Raven, never flitting, still is 
sitting, still is sitting, On the 
pallid bust of Pallas just above my 
chamber door; And his eyes have all the 
seeming of a demon's that is dreaming, 
And the lamp-light o'er him streaming 
throws his shadow on the floor; And my 
soul from out that shadow that lies 
floating on the floor, Shall be lifted 
-- nevermore!

Well, it was written in 1845. Maybe

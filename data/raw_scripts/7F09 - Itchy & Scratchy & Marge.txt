ACT _ONE 
FADE IN: 
INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - KITCHEN Scene 2, 


MARGE is in the kitchen making dinner. We see her shaking 
a wide variety of spices onto some breaded pork chops. 
HOMER is looking over her shoulder, admiring her handiwork. 
We can hear Bart and Lisa LAUGHING 0.S. 
MARGE 
(LOW TO HERSELF) A dash of rosemary, a 
smidgen of thyme, a pinch of 
marjoram... 
HOMER 
You know, Marge, you make the best pork 
chops in the whole world. 
MARGE 
(GENUINE MODESTY) Oh now, Homer, 
they're nothing special. The extra 
ingredient is care. 
Marge continues spicing the pork chops. 
MARGE (CONT'D) 
A sprinkle of chervil, half a teaspoon 
of turmeric... 


Marge takes a garlic clove, puts it in her mouth and chews. 
She puffs on the pork chops.

«ss and a whisper of garlic. 
HOMER 
Marge, I'm gonna build you a spice 
rack! 
MARGE 
You don't have to go to all that 
trouble. 
HOMER 
It's no trouble. I've got a whole 
garageful of tools I never use. 
Homer exits. 
INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM 
Bart, Lisa and Maggie are watching TV. 
ON TV 
KRUSTY is looking through a spyglass. 
KRUSTY 
Hey, kids! I spy Itchy and Scratchy 
off the port bow! (KRUSTY LAUGH) 
We see the opening of the Itchy & Scratchy Show. Itchy and Seene® 
Scratchy are running towards the camera POUNDING each other é 
over the head with mallets as the THEME SONG plays. 
ITCHY AND SCRATCHY CHORUS 
"They fight, they bite / they fight and 
bite and fight / fight, fight, fight / 
bite, bite, bite / The Itchy and 
Scratchy show." 


On the couch we see Maggie watching with wide-eyed 
fascination.

KIDS' Pov - TV seene*z 
We see Homer, from chest to knees, walk through the f.g. 
BART (0.S.) 
Down in front! 
HOMER 
Shut up, boy. 
SUPER: "HOLD THAT FELINE" 
Scratchy is waiting for the kick-off on a football field. 
Itchy lights a fuse in a teed-up football and kicks off. 
Scratchy fields the ball and there's a huge EXPLOSION, 
leaving a crater in the field. A scorched, blackened 
Scratchy falls into the hole and is immediately jumped on 
by an entire football team coming from all directions. 
INT. GARAGE - CONTINUOUS 
Homer crosses the obviously unused garage that's packed 
with obviously unused tools, many with the original plastic 
still covering them. He walks to a shelf that has every 
handyman encyclopedia ever made. 
HOMER 
(TO HIMSELF) I knew all this stuff 
would come in handy some day. Let's 
see now... ah, here it is. The 
Complete Handyman's Bookshelf. Volume 
One. Spice Racks. 
Homer takes the volume off the shelf and puts it on his 
unused workbench. He crosses to a small pile of unused 
wood, selects one that still has the small red flag on it, 
lays it on the workbench and opens the spice rack book to 
page one. 
HOMER (CONT'D) 
(READING) "Pick - up - a - ham - 
mer..." 


He picks up a hammer. It has a price tag dangling from it.

SAME SCENE - HALF HOUR LATER 
Homer has nailed a number of small pieces of wood together 
in a form that could pass for a spice rack. He frequently 
consults the book for reference. There is a pile of 
discarded wood on the floor with nails sticking out of each 
piece at crazy angles. Homer is sweating and MUTTERING. 

DISSOLVE TO: 
CLOSE-UP - SPICE RACK IN BOOK 


We PULL OUT to Homer holding up his finished spice rack. 
It looks terrible. 


HOMER (CONT'D) 

(AWED BY HIS ACHIEVEMENT) Wowww.... 
Suddenly we HEAR PSYCHO-TYPE MUSIC stings. 
NEW ANGLE 
Maggie is on the stairway above Homer's head. She is 
holding a large mallet. As the PSYCHO MUSIC continues, she 
bashes Homer over the head with all her might. 

DISSOLVE TO: 

EXTREME CLOSEUP - HOMER'S EYE 


In a move exactly like the end of the shower scene in 
"Psycho," 


CAMERA MOVES OUT 
to Homer's lifeless body which is sprawled on the garage 
floor. We hear a deep dull TRAGIC STING and the scene 
slowly fades. 
INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM = LATER THAT EVENING 
Homer is lying on the couch, his head bandaged. Large 
quantities of blood have dried on the bandages. Marge is 
fussing with his pillow. Bart and Lisa are sitting on the 
couch too, trying to see around Homer's swollen head so 
they can watch TV. 

BART 


Hey, Dad. Can you move your head?

HOMER Ceratt'd) 


(SELF-PITY) No, I can't. It's broken. 
Maggie walks up to Homer and SUCKS. Homer backs away. 
HOMER 
(SCREAMS) Keep her away from me, 
Marge! She's got that crazy look in 
her eyes again. 
MARGE 
Come on, Maggie. 
Marge picks up Maggie and sets her down in front of the TV. 
MARGE 
Where would an innocent child get the 
idea to attack her father with a 
mallet? 
ON TV 


Scenety 


We can see that an Itchy & Scratchy cartoon (TITLE CARD: 
"KITCHEN KUT-UPS") is on TV. The two stars are dressed as 
chefs and are WHACKING each other over the head with meat 
tenderizing mallets with tremendous force as the food they 
are preparing burns. 
BACK TO LIVING ROOM 
BART/LISA 
(LAUGH) 
MARGE 
(GASP) Could television be 


responsible?

ON TV CONT'D 


Scratchy is pinned to a butcher block with knives through 
his clothing. Itchy is trying to stab him, but Scratchy's 
chest keeps moving sideways to avoid being hit. Finally, 
Itchy stabs him in the heart. In the b.g. there's a 
butcher's chart showing various cuts of cat. 
BACK TO LIVING ROOM 
Maggie picks up a sharp pencil and starts heading for 
Homer, the pencil raised in her clenched fist. We start to 
hear the PSYCHO STINGS again, but they stop when Marge 
picks Maggie up and takes away the pencil. 
MARGE 
So, that's where she gets it! No, 
Maggie! Bad baby! 
Marge turns off the TV. 
BART/LISA 
We were watching that! 
MARGE 
Well, you won't be watching these 
cartoons anymore. Ever. 
LISA 
But, Mom! If you take our cartoons 
away, we'll grow up without a sense of 
humor and be robots. 
BART 
(TO LISA. INTERESTED) Really? What 
kind of robots? 
EXT. SCHOOLGROUNDS - NEXT MORNING Scenets 
Bart is walking up to the monkeybars, where MILHOUSE is 
hanging upside down eating part of his lunch. NELSON 


crosses to Bart and puts a sympathetic hand on his 
shoulder.

(SOMBERLY) I heard about the cartoons. 
Tough break, man. 

BART 
Thanks, Nelson. (TO MILHOUSE) So... 
Milhouse... what did I miss yesterday? 

MILHOUSE 
Scratchy was a mad scientist and he 
built this big, cool machine with all 
kinds of electrodes and dials and 
everything... 

NELSON 
And then he hit Itchy over the head 
with it. 

BART 
(PAINED) Aw, I've only seen that one 
three times. 

MILHOUSE 
Hey, what if you watch Itchy and 


Scratchy over at my house? 


BART 
Hmmm... It's just crazy enough to work. 
INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - THAT AFTERNOON Scénete 


Homer is laying down on the couch surrounded by empty 
plates, beer cans, and snack product bags. He's talking on 
the phone.

(INTO PHONE) You heard me. I won't be 
in for the rest of the week. (LISTENS) 
I told you. My baby beat me up. 
(LISTENS) It is not the worst excuse I 
ever thought up. 
Homer hangs up the phone as Marge enters carrying a 
looseleaf notebook and looks around the childless living 
room. 
MARGE 
I wonder why Bart and Lisa are so late 
getting home from school? 
INT. MILHOUSE'S HOUSE = LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Bart and Milhouse are sitting in front of the TV LAUGHING. 
ON TV 
The title card reads "Messenger of Death." The doorbell 
RINGS. Scratchy answers it. Itchy is there with a bazooka 
and BLASTS him to bits.

Lisa and JANEY are watching Itchy & Scratchy and LAUGHING. 
INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 


Marge is frowning and making notes in her small looseleaf 
notebook. Homer is watching her curiously from the couch. 


HOMER 
Hey, how come you can watch cartoons 
but the kids can't? 

MARGE 
(PREOCCUPIED) Because.

Because why?

MARGE 
(FRUSTRATED) Homer! I'm trying to 
work! 
HOMER 
Oh. (BEAT) What are you doing? 
MARGE 
I'm cataloguing the violence in these 
cartoons. I don't think adults have 
ever actually sat down and watched them 
before. 
ON TV 
Itchy hits Scratchy in the back of the head with a 
sledgehammer. Scratchy's eyes fly out. Scratchy staggers 
around looking for them. Itchy gives Scratchy two HISSING 
bombs. Scratchy forces the bombs into his eyesockets, then 
goes over to a mirror and begins combing his hair. He sees 
his reflection in the mirror, notices the bombs and runs 
around SCREAMING until he EXPLODES. 
BACK TO HOMER AND MARGE 
MARGE 
What kind of warped human being would 
find that funny? 
HOMER 


Heh, heh, heh.

Marge checks a box that says "Cats Blown Up." Other boxes 
that have already been checked include "Mice Launched," 
"Dogs Tricked," "Gophers Buried Alive," "Eyes Knocked Out," 
"“Disembowelings" and "Brains Slammed In Car Door." 
MARGE 
(SHAKING HER HEAD) This is the kind of 
entertainment they think is suitable 
for younger and more impressionable 
viewers? 
HOMER 
(CHUCKLES AT SOMETHING ON TV) Yeah, 
but what are ya gonna do? 
MARGE 
(SUDDEN RESOLUTION) I'll tell you what 
I'm going to do. I'm going to put a 
stop to it. 
HOMER 
You are? When? 
MARGE 
Right now. (DRAMATICALLY) Homer, I'm 
going to write a letter. 
Marge goes over to the desk and sits down. She takes out a 


sheet of writing paper that is headed "From the Mind of 
Marge" and begins writing.

EXT. ITCHY & SCRATCHY INTERNATIONAL - FRONT GATE 
We see a mammoth factory, with tall stacks belching black 
smoke. The massive wrought iron gates say "Itchy & 
Scratchy International." The logo features a wrought iron 
cat chopping a mouse in half vertically with an axe. The 
camera MOVES IN slowly through the bars. 
INT. I & S INTERNATIONAL - ANIMATOR'S OFFICE 
An ANIMATOR, who has an office with a window, is reading 
Marge's letter. Crude drawings of Itchy and Scratchy 
destroying each other line the walls of his office. There 
are also several tacky looking awards. 
MARGE (0.S.) (CONT'D) 
"... please try to tone down the 
psychotic violence..."

poster of Itchy and Scratchy endorsing Duff Beer and a 

bottle of Itchy and Scratchy cologne. Behind him are 
airbrushed portraits of Itchy & Scratchy. He is reading

FADE IN: 
EXT. ITCHY & SCRATCHY INTERNATIONAL - FRONT GATE 
Marge, Homer, Maggie, Bart, and Lisa are all picketing. 
Marge is carrying a sign that says "I'm protesting because 
Itchy & Scratchy are indirectly responsible for my husband 
being hit on the head with a mallet." This sign is very 
hard to read from any distance and curious PASSERSBY are 
forced to stand very close to the sign and squint. Homer 
is carrying a sign that says "Please ban violent cartoons. 
Next time I might not be so lucky." Maggie is waving a 
little sign like a pennant. It says "Stop me before I kill 
my father again." Bart and Lisa are both unhappily 
carrying signs that say "Ban Itchy & Scratchy." Bart 
surreptitiously writes in the word "Don't" at the top of 
his sign and looks less unhappy. 
HOMER 
(LOW, TO MARGE) Everybody's looking at 
us, Marge. 
MARGE 
That's what we want them to do, Homer. 
HOMER 
Oh. (BEAT) How long are we going to 
be doing this? 
MARGE 
Well, I've never changed the world 
before, so I don't know how long it 
takes exactly. But if enough people 
take an interest... 


MAUDE FLANDERS stops, looks at Marge, then looks at a large 
free-standing sign near Homer. It says "Join SNUH NOW!" 


MAUDE 


Hello, Marge! What is "SNUH?"

It stands for "Springfieldians for 
Nonviolence, Understanding and 
Helping." I've started a crusade 
against cartoon violence. I can 
protect my own children, but there are 
many others whose minds are being 
warped every afternoon at four. 
Bart hears this and looks at his watch. 
BART 
That reminds me. I've gotta get over 
to Milhouse's and... uh... play sports. 
MARGE 
All right. 
Bart puts down his sign. Lisa puts hers down too. 
LISA 
And I'm going over to Janey's again. 
We're going to be... um... making the 
most of our childhood years. 
MARGE 
Have fun. 
BART/LISA 
We will. 


They hurry off, stifling guilty GIGGLES. Maude Flanders 
picks up Lisa's sign and joins the demonstration.

Marge is sitting on a chair in front of the TV with her 
looseleaf violence notebook. She is once again monitoring 
cartoons. Homer is sitting on the couch CHUCKLING at the

HOMER 
You know, some of these stories are

such interesting lives. 
MARGE 
So much needless brutality. I don't 
know if I'm having any impact at all. 
Marge looks at the TV, pencil poised. 
ON TV 
We see Itchy & Scratchy, dressed as big league ball 
players, beating the hell out of each other with baseball

MYERS 
(A LITTLE AWKWARD) I think that is 
baloney, Kent. And here's why. In 
preparing for this debate, I did a

startling thing. There was violence in 
the past, long before cartoons were 
invented.

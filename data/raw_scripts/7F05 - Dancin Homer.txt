THE SIMPSONS 
"Dancin' Homer" 
by 
Ken Levine & David Isaacs 
ACT ONE 
FADE IN: 
EXT. STADIUM ~- EVENING 
We open on a large stadium marquee that reads: 
"SPRINGFIELD WAR MEMORIAL STADIUM," "TONIGHT BASEBALL," 
SPRINGFIELD ISOTOPES VS. SHELBYVILLE SHELBYVILLIANS," 
"NUCLEAR POWER PLANT FAMILY NIGHT," "SUNDAY AFTERNOON -- 
SWAP MEET." 


A bus comes ROARING by the screen as it enters the stadium 
parking lot. 


OTTO 
Hey, I think we're here, man. 
There's a loud CHEER from the bus. 
INT. BUS.= CONTINUOUS 
It is crammed with excited NUCLEAR POWER PLANT EMPLOYEES 
AND THEIR FAMILIES, all with hats, pennants, thermoses, 
flasks, gloves, etc. THE SIMPSONS are jammed into two 
rows. OTTO, the driver, pulls the bus to a stop. 
OTTO 
Okay now, after the game, we'll meet 
right here. We're in the blue parking 
lot, section D, spaces 11, 12, 6, & 7. 
The bus itself can be identified by the 


serial number on the engine, which is 


00773. 


TABLE DRAFT 5/01/90 2. 


INT. PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS 
We see that it is the only bus in this expansive dirt lot. 
BART 
How 'bout if we just come back to the 
only bus in the lot? 
OTTO 
Whoa! Let me think... okay, that'll 
work too. 
ON THE SIMPSONS 
as they cross with other fans to the front gate. BART has 
a mitt, LISA a transistor radio; MAGGIE wears a little 
baseball cap and uniforn jumper. They pass souvenir stands 
and PROGRAM VENDORS. All the EMPLOYEES who work at the 
ballpark are rundown and toothless. 
HOMER 
You know, boy, some of the players you 
see tonight may make it to the big 
leagues, one day. 
BART 
What? Aren't we going to see any 
washed-up major leaguers? 


HOMER 


Oh, sure. 


TABLE DRAFT 5/01/90 3. 


LISA 
Ah, minor league baseball. The game at 
its purest. I can't think of a better 
place to spend a balmy summer's night 
than the old ballyard. There's just 
the green grass of the outfield, the 
crushed brick of the infield, and the 
white chalk lines that divide the man 
from the little boy. 

HOMER 
(CHUCKLES) Lisa, honey, you're 
forgetting the beer. It comes in 
seventy-two ounce tubs here. 

MARGE 
I hope you'll space out the tubs this 
year, Homer. 

HOMER 
(DEFENSIVE) What are you getting at? 

MARGE 
Well, last year you got a little 
rambunctious and mooned the poor 
umpire. 

HOMER 
Marge, (HOLDING UP THE TICKET) this 
ticket doesn't just give me a seat, it 
also gives me the right to make a 


complete ass of myself. 


TABLE DRAFT 5/01/90 4. 


ENTRANCE TO STADIUM 
MR. BURNS and SMITHERS, who holds 3x5 index "prompt" cards, 
are perched at the gate, greeting the employees and their 
families. 
BURNS 
Ah, the Gammills. Good to see you. (TO 
MRS. GAMMILL) Did you know your 
husband is in the eighty-seventh 
percentile of our productivity scale? 
GAMMILL 
Your leadership and dedication are an 
inspiration to all of us in waste 
management, sir. 
BURNS 
(CHUCKLES) Well, take your mind off 
contaminates for one night and have a 
hot dog. 
Gammill and his brood kow-tow and move on. 
BURNS 
(TO SMITHERS) Put a little smile on 
his card, Smithers. 
SMITHERS 
Already there, Sir. 


Burns spots the Simpsons as they approach. Smithers grabs 
a card and WHISPERS in Burns' ear. 


BURNS 
Ah, well, if it isn't the Simps. 


Welcome. 


TABLE DRAFT 5/01/90 5. 


HOMER 


Uh... Simp-sons, sir. 


BURNS 
(CONSULTING CARD) Ah, yes... Homer and 
Marge Simpson. And these must be Bart, 
Lisa and "Expecting". 

SMITHERS , 
(SOTTO) The card needs to be updated, 


r 


Sir. _ 
MARGE 
Our baby's name is Maggie. 
SMITHERS 
Don't waste my time, woman. Just write 
it on the card. 
Smithers hands the card to Marge. 
HOMER 
Oh, that's okay. The baby's name isn't 
important. Let's go, Marge. 
BURNS 
Very well. (CHUCKLES) Take your mind 
off of contaminates for one night and 


have a hot dog. 


The Simpsons enter the park. 


TABLE DRAFT 5/01/90 6. 


EXT. PARK - CONTINUOUS 
It's a typical wooden-bandbox minor league ballpark, 
seating maybe five thousand. Ringing the outfield wall are 
the usual billboards filled with local advertisements: 
"Springfield Savings -- Safe from 1890-1986, 1988;" "His 
Royal Majesty: Clothing for the Obese or Gangly Gentleman; 
"Moe's Tavern - Hit this sign and win a free well drink;" 
"Radio Station WBVD Rocks Soft." 
The only concession to the modern era is the JumboVision 
board in left field, which dwarfs the rest of the stadium. 
The PLAYERS are on the field, leisurely taking batting and 
infield practice as the stadium organist plays "ALEXANDER'S 
RAGTIME BAND." 
BART 
Oh, wow -- there's Flash Bailor! I 
gotta get his autograph! He used to be 
a star! 
FLASH BAILOR 
He is playing catch. He's 45, arrogant and terribly out of 
shape. He looks like a giant pear. Bart leans over the 
railing, holding out a ball and a pen. 
BART 
Hey, Flash! Willya sign my ball? 
FLASH 
No. 
Bart rejoins the family. 
BART 
(MUMBLING) Lousy, washed up, broken 
down... old tub of guts... who does... 
HOMER 
What's the matter, boy? 
BART 


He wouldn't sign my ball. 


TABLE DRAFT 5/01/90 7. 


MARGE 
Well, I thought these ballplayers were 
supposed to set an example for 
children. Bart, give me that ball! 


Bart flips her the ball and, with great resolve, she 
marches down the aisle to the field. 


PLAYER 
Hey, Flash, check out the mature quail 


heading this way. 


FLASH 
Yeah, mama. 

MARGE 
Excuse me, Mr... Flash? 

FLASH 


Hi, there, little lady. What can I do 
for you? 
EXT. PARK - STANDS - A LITTLE LATER 
Marge rejoins the family, holding the ball. 
MARGE 
Here you go, Bart. 
She hands the ball to Bart. 
BART 
(READING) "Room 26, Springfield Kozy 
Kort...How 'bout it? -- Flash." (THEN) 


Hey, cool. 


TABLE DRAFT 5/01/90 8. 


HOMER 
Wow! Flash Bailor came on to ny wife! 
(IMPRESSED) You've still got the magic, 
Marge. 
EXT. BALLPARK - MOMENTS LATER 
The plant employees are positioned way down the right field 
line, in the bleachers. There's a filled section of 
them... and just a mere sprinkling of other fans throughout 
the park. There are two empty seats next to the Simpsons. 
Lisa is holding up Maggie. 
HOMER 
(TO LISA) What are you doing? 
LISA 
Trying to get Maggie on the 
JumboVision. 
SERIES OF QUICK CUTS - GRANDSTAND. 
We see that HUNDREDS OF BABIES are being held up. 
HOMER — 
Oh, Lisa, they'll never show a Simpson. 
We're the most anonymous family in 
America. 
BART 
(POINTING) Hey, Dad, look. 
Homer glances up. 
HOMER 
Whoa! 
ON JUMBOVISION BOARD. 


Homer fills the screen. He stands up and waves with both 
hands. 


TABLE DRAFT 5/01/90 9. 


HOMER (V.0.) 
Hey everybody! How you doing? Look at 
me! How you doing, everybody? I'm 
Homer Simpson! 


Bart leans into frame and raises two fingers behind Homer's 
head. The JumboVision camera starts to pull in on Homer's 


open fly. 
MARGE 
(QUIETLY) Homer... Homer... X.Y.Z. 
HOMER (V.O.) 
Examine my zipper? Why? (HOMER LOOKS 
DOWN) Whoops! 


Homer, still on the screen, turns away, zips up his fly and 
receives a nice OVATION from the crowd. 


P.A. ANNOUNCER (V.O.) 
(HEAVILY ECHOED) Ladies and gentlemen, 
throwing out tonight's first ball, the 
man whose name is synonymous with our 
nation's safest and cleanest energy 
source, Mr. Montgomery Burns! 
Burns and Smithers drive up to the mound in a golf cart 


that looks like a big baseball. Burns waves to the crowd. 
There is a slight SMATTERING OF APPLAUSE. As the golf cart 


brakes, divots of turf fly. 
SMITHERS 


They love you, Sir. 


TABLE DRAFT 5/01/90 10. 


BURNS 
You know, Smithers, when I was a young 
buck, my patented fadeaway pitch was 
compared to the trouble ball of the 
great Satchel Page. 
SMITHERS 
You're still my favorite player, sir. 
Burns hands Smithers the ball. 
BURNS 
Spit on this for me, Smithers. 
SMITHERS 
One hocker coming up, sir. 
Burns rocks into his wind-up. 
ON THE SIMPSONS 
who are heckling Burns from their very safe distance. 
HOMER 
Hey, Burns! Hey, "Rag Arm"! 
BART 
You throw like my sister, man! 
LISA 
Yeah, you throw like me. 
They LAUGH conspiratorially. 
BACK TO BURNS 


He wheels and deals. He loses his balance and the ball 
goes maybe six feet before trickling to a stop. 


SMITHERS 
I think I could actually hear the air 


being torn, sir. 


TABLE DRAFT 5/01/90 11. 


BURNS 
Oh, shut up. 


Homer and Bart are roaring with LAUGHTER. They can barely 
contain themselves. 


BART 
What a lame-o! 

P.A. ANNOUNCER (V.0.) 
Ladies and gentlemen, to honor America, 
will you please rise for our National 


Anthem... 


Homer quickly composes himself. 
P.A. ANNOUNCER (V.O.) 
...sung tonight by Springfield's rhythm 
`n! blues sensation, Sean "Bleeding 
Gums" Murphy. 
BLEEDING GUMS MURPHY steps up to the microphone at home 
plate. We see the scoreboard clock behind him reads 7:30. 


Bleeding Gums launches into a wildly improvisational 
version of the National Anthem: 


BLEEDING GUMS 
(SINGING) “O-oo-hhhhhhh...Saaaaa-yyyyy 
can you..." -- I'm askin' -- "Can you 
s-e-e-e?...By the d-a-a-a-w-wn's early 
light. What so proudly, so proudly..." 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. BALLPARK - NIGHT 


Bleeding Gums is still singing. The clock on the 
scoreboard now reads 7:46.

BLEEDING GUMS 
",..the land of the free -eeeeeeeeee

and...the home... oh yes... the home... 
I said the home... of the...brave!" 


We see the Simpsons amid the crowd. Exhausted, they flop 
into their chairs. 


IN PRESSBOX 


DAN HOARD, wearing a loud, multi-colored jacket, is at the 
mike. 


DAN HOARD 

Hi-de-hi, Springfield! Dan Hoard, 
mikeside. We've got a barnburner 
tonight ~- our Isotopes versus the 
pesky Shelbyville Shelbyvillians. The 
'Topes are looking to snap a twenty-six 
game losing streak, longest in 
professional baseball. How 'bout that? 
-- Our sleepy town is in the record 
book! 

ON GRANDSTAND 


Burns and Smithers come down the aisle in the employees’ 
roped-off section. Burns clutches two tickets. 


TABLE DRAFT 5/01/90 13. 


BURNS 
Ah, sitting with the employees. I 
guess this proves I'm one of the gang. 
(THEN) You did get me something on an 
aisle, Smithers? I don't want to be 
surrounded by them. 


Burns spots MR. AND MRS. WINFIELD sitting in seats near the 
aisle. 


BURNS (CONT'D) 
Hey, you two are in our seats! Usher, 
have these squatters thrown out of 
here! And I want charges filed!! 
SMITHERS 
No... Sir... Our seats are down there. 
BURNS 
Oh, very well. Buy them some peanuts. 
ON SIMPSONS 
Homer and Bart are engaged in loud baseball chatter. 
HOMER 
Let's go now...Sa-winggg, batter! 
BART 
We want a pitcher/ Not a belly itcher! 
LISA 
We want a catcher/ Not a belly 
scratcher! 


Homer and Bart are on their feet, making faces. Burns and 
Smithers approach. 


TABLE DRAFT 5/01/90 14. 


SMITHERS 


Here we are, Sir. 


Homer spots them and lets out an involuntary LITTLE SHRIEK. 
Smithers dusts off Burns' seat and the two sit down. 


HOMER 


(SOTTO) Oh, Marge, sitting next to 


the boss -- the best night of the year, 


and it's ruined! (GRUMBLING) Of all 


the lousy, rotten... this stinks... I 


never get a break... 


MARGE 


All this means is you can't wave your 


fanny in public. 


HOMER 


(WHINING) Oh! I wasn't even thinking 


about that! 


Homer and Burns look at 
Neither one wants to be 
CRACK of the bat. Bart 


Foul ball -- 


Everyone in the section 


Burns turns to Smithers. 


each other and smile sheepishly. 
there. Suddenly, there is a LOUD 
leaps to his feet, waving his mitt. 
BART 

headed right for us! 


stands, poised for the souvenir. 


BURNS 


Smithers, my glove! Hurry -- Get me 


old Emma! 


Smithers immediately produces an old-era, small, flat mitt 


and hands it to Burns. 


There's a sea of waving hands and 


mitts as the ball approaches. 


TABLE DRAFT 5/01/90 15. 


BART 
It's mine! I got it! I got it! 
BURNS 
No. I've got it! 
BART 
I got it! 
BURNS 
The hell you say. I got it! 


Bart, leaping off his seat, makes a spectacular catch, 
almost falling off the tier. 


BART 
Yes!!! 
Bart holds the ball up in his glove. Homer WHACKS the 
glove. The ball falls into Burns' glove. A thrilled Burns 
examines his prize. 
BURNS 
I got it, Smithers! I got it! 
BART 
(TO HOMER) Hey! 
HOMER 
(SOTTO) Shut up. I'll buy you a whole 
box of balls. 
Burns sticks the ball in Bart's face. 
BURNS 
(TAUNTINGLY) Feast your eyes on this, 
little man! Genuine horse-hide, 
stitched in Haiti. Read it and weep! 


Homer holds back Bart, who has a very hurt expression on i 
his face. 


TABLE DRAFT 5/01/90 16. 


VENDOR (0.S.) 
Beeerheah! Duff Beer! 
HOMER 
(WISTFULLY SOTTO) Beer. Didja hear 
that, Marge? Delicious frosty beer. 
Fat lot of good that does me, sitting 
next to old man Burns. 
MARGE 
(WARNING) Now, Homer. 
BURNS 
(TO HOMER) I suppose you want a beer? 
HOMER 
Me, sir? Oh, no. Not a chance. Only 
idiots drink beer. 
BURNS 
Are you sure? Actually, I was 
wondering if you'd join me. My treat. 
HOMER 
Oh, well if someone of your stature can 
enjoy a beer, maybe I'm all turned 
around on the subject. Wait a minute, 
we're not having a drug test tomorrow, 
are we? 
BURNS 
No. (TO VENDOR) Two, please. 


Vendor starts to fill two huge buckets of beer. 


TABLE DRAFT 5/01/90 17. 


VENDOR 
That'll be three seventy-five. 
Burns takes a wad of hundreds out of his pocket. 
BURNS 
Oh dear, all I have are these lousy 
hundreds. 
HOMER ` 
Oh, I'll get these. 
BURKS | 
Very well. (CHUCKLES TO HIMSELF) 
Vendor hands over the beers. 
HOMER 
Don't go far, okay, buddy? 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. BALLPARK - LATER 
We see the players on the field. 
DAN HOARD (V.O.) 
Top of the fourth, Isotopes losing, 
six to 2. Remember, Friday is "Dental 
Care Night". A free toothbrush and gum 
stimulator for the first two thousand 
fans, so you're gonna want to be here. 


Homer and Burns are hoisting their half-empty tubs of beer. 
They're both feeling pretty loose, heckling the players. 


BURNS 
(CHANTING) The hitter's off his 


rocker/Kissing Betty Crocker! 


TABLE DRAFT 5/01/90 18. 


HOMER 
Good one, sir. 
BURNS 
I used to rile the late, great Connie 
Mack with that one at old Shibe Park. 
HOMER 
(CHANTING) Little baby batter/Can't 
control his bladder! 
BURNS 
Crude, but I like it. (THEN HOLDING UP 
72 OZ. TUB) What do you say we 
freshen up these drinks? 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. BALLPARK - LATER 
We open close on the auxiliary scoreboard. The game is now 
in the sixth inning, Isotopes losing, six to four. We PAN 
UP to Homer and Burns. We see that Burns now has a lap- 
full of foul balls. Mr. Wolfe comes down the aisle with a 
foul ball, puts it in Burns' lap, and moves on. 
EXT. BALLPARK - LATER 
BURNS 
Well, Simpsie, you up for another wave? 
HOMER 
All right, Burnsie. 


Homer and Burns alternate standing up and sitting down. No 
one else follows.

Everyone up for the seventh inning stretch, SINGING and 
swaying to the stadium organist's rendition of "TAKE ME OUT

"So it's root, root, root for the

A Springfield batter is at the plate. The bases are 
loaded. The scoreboard shoes the game is in the ninth 
inning, with the score still 6-4. 
DAN HOARD (V.O.) 
Bases loaded. Topes have one out, down 
by three. Here's the pitch. Swung on 
and missed! Strike three. Of course. 
You don't lose twenty-seven games ina 
row by hitting the ball. 
BURNS 
Damnation! These banjos couldn't carry 


Pie Traynor's glove.

DAN HOARD 
Big Bill McCloskey's coming up. As 
soon as he pops out, we'll go right to 
the post-game show. 

HOMER 


C'mon! All we need is a grand slam. 


Everyone AD LIBS "Yeah, right", "I want a good seat on the 
bus", "That'll be the day." 
BURNS 
My one game of the year... ruined by 
incompetence. 
HOMER 


What's wrong with you people? Let's 

show some spirit! Come on, get up! 
The stadium organist begins to PLAY "BABY ELEPHANT WALK". 

HOMER 

(TO THE CROWD) What's the matter with 

you?! Your team needs you! C'mon!!! 
Swept up in the spirit of the moment and the music (and the 
beer), Homer climbs atop the auxiliary scoreboard and 


begins dancing to the music. AD LIBS from the crowd: 
"Look at him!", “Check out Simpson!", "Get a load'a that 


guy!" 
MARGE

Maggie's jaw drops. Her pacifier falls out of her mouth. 


TABLE DRAFT 5/01/90 21. 


HOMER 
Come on! Put those hands together! 
Stomp those feet! Get loud! 
Homer is dancing up a storm. A la Mick Jagger, he's 
prompting the crowd to begin CLAPPING. They do. Marge and 
the family are mortified. Everyone starts to CLAP their 
hands and STOMP their feet. 
DAN HOARD (V.O.) 
...there's some nut down in right 
field, dancin' up a storm! He's really 
got the crowd goin'. Let's hope it can 
shake up the usually unreliable "Big 
Bill" McCloskey. 
McCloskey swings and hits it to the moon. 
DAN HOARD (V.O. ,CONT'D) 
Swung on and belted to deep left field! 
It's going...going... 
SLOW MOTION SEQUENCE 
The flourish of "The Natural" is evoked. Homer and the 
crowd is frozen in anticipation. Even little Maggie stops 
sucking. 
DAN HOARD (V.0.) 
It's gone! It's outta here! Oh, my! 
Touch ‘em all! Dial eight! A-B- see 
you later! Oh my God, the Isotopes win 
a game! The Isotopes win a game! The 
Isotopes win a game! 
BACK TO NORMAL SPEED 
The crowd goes wild. Homer lifts his arms in the air and 


dances on the scoreboard. Burns and Smithers file out of 
the grandstand. 


TABLE DRAFT 5/01/90 22. 


SMITHERS 
Well, that was certainly exciting. 
BURNS 
Yes, unfortunately Homer Simpson's 
shameless display of exhibitionism 
tainted the entire evening. I want him 
banned for life from all company 
outings. 
The CHEERING goes on. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER 
The Simpsons are among the delirious fans heading back to 
the bus. People pat Homer on the back, AD LIBBING "You 
were great, Homer," "Way to go, Simpson," "You're better 
than that Chicken," etc. The Simpsons reach the bus, the 
only bus in the lot. People are congratulating him. 
HOMER 
Yeah, yeah. Well, thanks. Glad you 
enjoyed it, but I can't take all the 
credit. The batter did his part too. 


A middle-aged gentleman steps out of the shadows and taps 
Homer on the shoulder. His name is MR. O'HARA. 


MR. O'HARA 
Excuse me...You, sir -- the dancing 
fella. I'm Antoine "Tex" O'Hara, owner 
and general manager of the Isotopes. 
HOMER

MR. O'HARA 
Homer, I'm not firing you. I just got 
the word -- You've been called up to 
Capital City. 

HOMER 
What? The majors? 

MR. O'HARA 
Yes. The scouts have had their eye on 
you all season. They say you're the 
funniest looking guy to come along in 
the last ten years. 

HOMER 
But Capital City has a mascot. The 
greatest mascot there is: The Capital 
City "Goofball". 

MR. O'HARA 
He's a treasure of the game, no 
question... but he's also getting on in

hanging up his "head".

Anyway, he needs someone to fill in for

what d'ya say?

Wow. An opportunity far a better life. 
Is this the kind of thing people

Okay.

Well... until Lisa goes to college or 
you get a job.

doesn't mean, uh, uh... Marge, help me 
out here. 

MARGE 
Well, you'll be able to write to your 
old friends and you'll make new 
friends, so you'll end up having twice 
as many. 

BART 
Hey, simple arthimetic, can't argue 
with that. 

LISA 
Oh, Bart. Our social skills are not 
what you think. We're saplings. our 
young roots have spread in Springfield

reason The Almighty put us on this 
Earth. And yours might be to dance on 
dugouts.

Well, all I can say is that when I don

about being among all these greats of the game. The 
Goofball, in costume, sits with him.

on his Goofcycle, dropping his Goofshorts, etc.) that is 
going on behind hin. 
ON SCOREBOARD 
We're now in the second inning. 
ON HOMER. 
We hear his thoughts: 
HOMER (V.0.) 
You're gonna be great! They're gonna 
love you! You can do it! 
ON SCOREBOARD 
Now in the third. 
ON HOMER 
Still thinking; now sweating. 
HOMER (V.O.) (CONT'D) 


I'm a fraud! I'm gonna stink! They're 


gonna hate me!

ON SCOREBOARD 
Fourth inning. 
HOMER (V.O.) (CONT'D) 
I'm so hungry! Gee, those hot dogs 
smell good. I can be back by the fifth 
inning... easy. 
ON SCOREBOARD 
It's the moment of truth: the fifth inning has arrived. 
ANNOUNCER (V.O.) 
Ladies and gentlemen. Capital City's 
newest sensation, Dancin' Homer! 
A spotlight hits Homer who is sitting with a box full of 
hot dogs, peanuts, pretzels, beer, etc. in front of hin. 
He is MUNCHING on a hot dog when the spotlight hits hin. 
HOMER 
(TO HIMSELF) Mmm, these do taste better 
at the ballpark. These are really 
delici... 
The "Baby Elephant Walk" MUSIC starts. 
HOMER 
(WITH HIS MOUTH FULL) Uh oh. 


Homer crams the rest of the hot dog in his mouth, takes a 
big swig of beer, and starts dancing. 


ON SIMPSONS 
LISA 
(POINTING) There he is! 
THEIR POV 


A tiny speck on the dugout. 


TABLE DRAFT 5/01/90 49. 


ON HOMER 


Going through his routine. He's giving it everything he's 
got. 


Random shots of FACES in the crowd. They stare at Homer 
blankly. The last person YAWNS. 


ON HOMER 


He can sense it's not going well. He tries quickly 
spelling the letters. 


ON SIMPSONS 
Marge peering through binoculars and WHIMPERING. 
LISA 
Lemme see, Mom. 
MARGE 
All right, but just remember -- This is 
the only father you'll ever have. 
BART 
What's with this people? Why are they 
sitting on their hands? 
ON HOMER 
He is doing cartwheels. We PAN across random spectators. 
SPECTATOR #1 
This guy doesn't make me want to cheer. 
SPECTATOR #2 
He's not funny. He isn't goofy and he 
isn't agile. 
SPECTATOR #3 
Gee, I really pity him. Making a fool 


of himself in front of so many people. 


TABLE DRAFT 5/01/90 50. 


ON HOMER 


He's working his butt off. The Goofball has been watching 
from the dugout. 


HOMER 
(TO HIMSELF) Grab a kid! That always 
works. 
Homer races to the front row and tries to grab a CUTE 
LITTLE TYKE. HIS MOTHER smacks him with her purse. He 
tries ANOTHER ONE; the kid bites him. Homer, with a sick 
smile on his face, gives up and goes back to dancing. 
Suddenly there's a CHEER from the crowd. Homer is greatly 
relieved, until he looks behind him and sees the Goofball 
is mimicking Homer's dance with an exaggerated stomach. 
The Goofball joins Homer. They end their dance together to 
huge AUDIENCE REACTION. 
HOMER (CONT'D) 
Thanks, Goof for saving my butt. 
The Goofball HONKS his nose to the delight of the audience. 
INT. LOCKER ROOM - LATER 
After the game. A dejected Homer is at his locker, wearing 
only a jock strap. An old, wizened CLUBHOUSE ATTENDANT 
approaches. 
CLUBHOUSE ATTENDANT 
Hey, Mr. Showmanship! The owner wants 
to see you in his office right now. 
CLOSE ON -- A FROSTED GLASS DOOR 
The words "DAVE ROSENFIELD - OWNER" are on it. TWO HUMAN 


FORMS are made out through the glass. One, wearing only a 
jock strap, has his back to us.

DAVE ROSENFIELD (0.S.) 
Sorry, young man; you're just not 
ready. Gonna hafta send you back to 
where you came from. Pick up your 
check at the front office... and for 
God's sake, put some clothes on! 
INT. LOCKER ROOM - LATER 
The place is cleared out, save for a few LINGERING 
BALLPLAYERS. The old Clubhouse Attendant is lugging a 
sac):ful of dirty laundry, a sack which is three times his 
size. Homer, feeling pretty low, and The Goofball are 
sitting by Homer's locker, sharing brews. The Goofball is 
still wearing his costume, except now he has his "head" 
off. However, his actual head looks strangely similar to 
his costume head. 
GOOFBALL 
I know it's hard to swallow right now, 
Homer, but think of this: No matter 
what else happens in your drab life -- 
for one day, one shining moment, you 
got "the call". You were in "the 
Bigs", "the Show". They'll never be 
able to take that away from you, Homer. 
And you know something else? -- I don't 
think anyone'll ever try. 
HOMER 
(SNIFFLING) You're the salt of the 
earth, Goofball. 
EXT. STADIUM - PLAYERS AND MASCOT ENTRANCE 


The family is waiting for Homer to emerge. i

BART 
Well, I guess it's back to good old 
Springfield. 

LISA 
But I can't go back! Not after I've 
seen the bright lights of Capital City. 
I'll wither and die like a hothouse 
flower. 

MARGE 
Now stop it you two. And don't look 
too down. I'm sure this is hard enough 
for your father. 


Homer emerges and crosses to them. The family APPLAUDS and 
CHEERS. 


HOMER 
What a family. At least somebody still 
loves me. 
NEW ANGLE 


Reveals Goofball behind Homer leading the family ina 
cheer. Homer doesn't see this. 


MARGE 
Come on. Let's get in the car. 
EXT. SIMPSON HOUSE - NIGHT 
The loaded car pulls up in front of the house. 
INT. CAR - NIGHT 


The children are all asleep. 


TABLE DRAFT 5/01/90 53. 


HOMER 
Well, here we are. Back home, totally 
disgraced. I'm nothing but a big 
buffoon. 
MARGE 
Now, now, Homer. The way I see it is 
if you really were nothing but a big 
buffoon, we'd still be in Capital City. 
HOMER 
(BRIGHTENING) Hey, you're right. 
Homer kisses Marge. 
FADE OUT. 


THE END

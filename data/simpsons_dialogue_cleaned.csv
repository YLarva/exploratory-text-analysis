HOMER,"Yeah, but aren't we forgetting something, Flanders?",7F08   DEAD PUTTING SOCIETY
NED FLANDERS,"Oh, your beer. Is draft okay? Just put in the tap last week. Homer takes a big bite out of a club sandwich as Flanders takes a big stein labelled ""Macho Mug"" from his collection of steins and draws Homer a draft.",7F08   DEAD PUTTING SOCIETY
NED FLANDERS,"This is a tasty little lager called ""Van Alstein"".",7F08   DEAD PUTTING SOCIETY
HOMER,Never heard of it.,7F08   DEAD PUTTING SOCIETY
NED FLANDERS,It's imported all the way from Holland.,7F08   DEAD PUTTING SOCIETY

NED FLANDERS,"Why, you don't have to do that, son.",7F08   DEAD PUTTING SOCIETY
TODD,"I know, but I want to. You're the best Dad in the whole world. Homer watches all this with wide-eyed amazement.",7F08   DEAD PUTTING SOCIETY
NED FLANDERS,"Now, you know how that embarrasses me. Todd exits.",7F08   DEAD PUTTING SOCIETY
NED FLANDERS,Kids can be a trial sometimes.,7F08   DEAD PUTTING SOCIETY
HOMER,"All right, knock it off!",7F08   DEAD PUTTING SOCIETY
HOMER,You've been rubbing my nose in it since I got here. Your family is better than my family. Your beer comes from farther away than my beer. You and your son like each other. Your wife's butt is higher than my wife's butt. You make me sick!,7F08   DEAD PUTTING SOCIETY
NED FLANDERS,"Simpson, I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to leave. I hope you understand.",7F08   DEAD PUTTING SOCIETY
HOMER,I wouldn't stay on a bet!,7F08   DEAD PUTTING SOCIETY
MARGE,"Homer, quit tossing.",7F08   DEAD PUTTING SOCIETY
HOMER,"Sorry, Marge. It's just that I'm still steamed up about that jerk Flanders. Lousy... bragging... know- it-all... show-off...",7F08   DEAD PUTTING SOCIETY
HOMER,"Get this. He said... well... okay, look, I don't have a legal transcript, but it wasn't so much what he said, it was how he said it!",7F08   DEAD PUTTING SOCIETY
MARGE,"Well, how did he say it? Was he angry? Was he rude?",7F08   DEAD PUTTING SOCIETY
HOMER,"Okay, okay. It wasn't how he said it either, but the message was loud and clear... We stink!",7F08   DEAD PUTTING SOCIETY
MARGE,"Homer, as your best friend, I've seen you bad-mouth Ned Flanders for years and, frankly, I've never seen him be anything but a perfect neighbor.",7F08   DEAD PUTTING SOCIETY

HOMER,I'm just gonna go take a walk around the block to calm down. I got a little excited.  I'm not perfect.,7F08   DEAD PUTTING SOCIETY
MAUDE,"Ned, you're tossing. What's the matter?",7F08   DEAD PUTTING SOCIETY
NED FLANDERS,I feel terrible. I forget that we do have things better than the Simpsons. I have him over. He has a few beers. You can't blame him for erupting. And what do I do? I turn into a snarling beast. Talk about flunking turn-the- other-cheek!,7F08   DEAD PUTTING SOCIETY

BART,"Give up, Homer. There's a six-stroke",7F08   DEAD PUTTING SOCIETY
HOMER,"I know, I know. I can still make this for a five.  Come on, baby, pleeze go in. Please let me beat the boy. Homer's shot bonks oft the gorilla's face and rolls back down the ramp, hitting Homer's putter with a delicate PING. Bart LAUGHS. Homer throws down his club.",7F08   DEAD PUTTING SOCIETY

HOMER,That shot is impossible! Jack Nicholson himself couldn't make it.,7F08   DEAD PUTTING SOCIETY

BART,"Homer, it's hopeless.",7F08   DEAD PUTTING SOCIETY

HOMER,"But, Marge, this is our big chance to show up the Flanderses.",7F08   DEAD PUTTING SOCIETY
MARGE,"Well, I'm sure it is, but why do we want to do that?",7F08   DEAD PUTTING SOCIETY

HERMAN,"Okay... The key to Springfield has always been Elm Street: The Greeks knew it. The Carthaginians knew it. I knew it. Now you know it. First, you'll need a declaration of war.

MARGE, SINGING, scurries about the kitchen preparing
breakfast and packing lunch boxes for the family. The OVEN »
TIMER
goes off and she removes a tray containing four
perfect little Squares of toast and serves them to Maggie.
MARGE
Here’s your toast, Maggie. I Melba-
. fied it myself.


Magate stacks up the squares, KARATE CHOPS them in half,
and starts cramming the bits in her mouth. LISA enters.


MARGE
(CONT’D)
Oh, Lisa, honey, I tracked down those
old newspapers for your history
project.
She indicates a stack of yellowed newspapers. The top :
headline reads: "AMERICA LOVES TED KENNEDY," with a photo
of a slim, young, cheerful TED.KENNEDY.
LISA.

’ (EXAMINING PAPERS) Wow, Mom. You
-didn’t -have to-go to this much trouble.

Oh, it was no trouble. The hobos at

MARGE
No they didn’t. And put on this tie.
It picks up the color of your eyes.


She clips on a black tie. Passing by Lisa, she removes a
sign scotch-taped to her back saying "I’m A Stupid Baby."


- MARGE (CONT'D)
And don’t put signs on your sister.


She starts to close the lunch boxes, notices a SQUEAKY
hinge, oils it, and hands the boxes to the kids.


MARGE
(CONT’D)
Now, keep the lettuce separate until
11:30. (TOO EXCITED) That way, the
lettuce stays moist..and the bread stays
dry! © (PRETTY CLEVER, -HUH?) Eh?) Eh?
LISA
Mom, you fuss over us way too much.


The kids leave.

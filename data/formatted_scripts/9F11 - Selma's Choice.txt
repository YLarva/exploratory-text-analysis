INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY
ON
TV
We see a MAN set a row of school buses on fire. A
MOTORCYCLE DAREDEVIL GUNS
his engine then ROARS up a ramp
and soars over the flaming school buses. After landing
successfully, he raises his arms overhead in a victory
gesture and immediately collides with a cement wall.
ANNOUNCER
(V.0.)
Hey Lance Murdock! You just jumped 16
blazing school buses. What are you
going to do now?
LANCE
MURDOCK
(IN PAIN) I’m going to Duff Gardens.
cur To:
Lance, sporting a number of braces, casts and bandages, is
sitting in a roller coaster car that’s climbing a steep
hill.
ANNOUNCER
(V.0O.)
Duff Gardens! Home of "The
Whiplash."
We see an airplane cruising along, well below Lance’s
roller coaster car. Lance looks uneasy. The car reaches
the top of the hill and hurtles down the slope, which seems
to be several miles high.

The roller coaster goes down, then does a 360. Murdock
falls out at the apex. He SCREAMS then lands back in the
car, upside down, his legs sticking out.
ANNOUNCER
(V.0.) (CONT’D)
"The Washing Machine"!
Lance and several other SCREAMING TOURISTS are pinned to
the wall of a spinning cylinder. A huge agitator sprays
them with soapy water.
ANNOUNCER
(V.0O.) (CONT/D)
++. and "The Contusion"!
We see a giant version of the desk toy with five swinging
balls. FIVE PEOPLE in harnesses mimic the action of the
colliding balls. Lance Murdock is in the center, unhappily
absorbing the collisions from both sides.

Wowww.


The phone RINGS. HOMER answers without taking his eyes off
the TV.


HOMER
(INTO PHONE) Y’ello... yeah...
yeah... Okay, I’1l tell her. Oh, I’m
driving into a tunnel now. We may be
cut off.
Homer hangs up.
ON
TV
We see a room full of SINGING animatronic BEER MUGS a la


Disneyland’s "Tiki Room." The lids on the mugs CLACK
noisily as they "SING."

Tap your feet to the good-time

Anybody here/ see my old friend,
Martin?/ Can you tell me where he’s
gone?
ANNOUNCER
(V.O.)
Or just lie back and have beer poured
into your mouth on our fabulous Beer
Tours ride.
We see SEVERAL MEN with beer bellies riding in moving
recliner chairs. As they pass under giant beer kegs
labelled "Duff," "Duff Lite," "Duff With Fluoride," etc.
beer squirts into their mouths.
HOMER
(EXCITED) Bart, warm up the car.
We’re going to Duff Gardens.
BART AND
LISA
Yayyy!
Bart and Lisa run out.
MARGE
Who was that on the phone?
HOMER
Uh... some guy.
MARGE


What did he say?


9F11 TABLE DRAFT 6/15/92


HOMER
Your Aunt Gladys is dead... or was it
sick? Let’s see... siii... no
dead... That’s it. (SNAPS FINGERS)
Definitely dead.
Marge reacts with shock.
INT. SIMPSON HOUSE -
BART’S BEDROOM - MORNING


Bart and Lisa are getting dressed for a day at Duff
Gardens. Marge and Homer appear in the doorway.


MARGE
Kids, I have some bad news. Your
Great Aunt Gladys has... passed on.
BART
(SEARCHING MEMORY) Gladys, Gladys...
‘pout yay high, blue hair, big dent
in her forehead?
MARGE
No honey, Gladys looked more like
your Aunt Patty.


Bart searches his memory. There is a noticeable shudder as
he places the face.


BART
Oh yeah, there she is.

MARGE
The funeral’s in Little Neck Falls.
It looks like we’1ll have to go to
Duff Gardens another time.


Bart and Lisa nod.


9F11 TABLE DRAFT 6/15/92


LISA
We understand.
BART
(SHRUGGING) No use complaining about
something you can’t change.
HOMER
(KICKING FLOOR) But I wanna go to
Duff Gardens. Right now!
MARGE
Oh Homer, quit pouting.
HOMER
I’m not pouting. I’m... mourning.
(MUTTERING) Stupid dead woman.
INT. SIMPSON STATION WAGON - DAY
The family is all dressed in their church clothes. Bart and
Lisa sit in the way back under an old army blanket. A lot
of luggage is lashed to the roof. Bart and Homer are
SINGING
"John Jacob Jingle-Heimer Schmidt."
HOMER
(WHISPERING - SINGING) Whenever we go
out..
BART
(WHISPERING- SINGING) The people
always shout..
HOMER
(WHISPERING - SINGING) There goes
John Jacob something, something


Schmidt.

HOMER AND
BART
(SCREAMIMG) BA DA BA DA BA -
MARGE
(SHARPLY) If you don’t mind! We’re on
our way to a funeral.
Homer and Bart hang their heads.
HOMER
Sorry Marge. What do you want to
sing?
MARGE
I don’t want to sing anything!
Homer again hangs his head. The car pulls up to PATTY and
SELMA’S apartment. — They wait in front of the apartment
building, dressed in black. Homer gets out of the car.
HOMER
(SOMBERLY) Patty. Selma. I’m sorry.
He pulls them into an embrace.
SELMA
(TO PATTY) He’s hugging us. What do
we do?
PATTY
(TO SELMA) Just pretend you’re
somewhere else.


Homer picks up their bags with some effort and throws them
in the way back with Bart and Lisa.


LISA
Hey, we’re crowded back here as it


is.

BART

My leg’s pinned under the luggage.
HOMER

So you be Peg Leg Pete. Geez, where’s

your imagination?

Homer gets in the car. Patty waits outside.

PATTY

All right everyone, look out the

window. I want to take a picture.


The Simpsons press their faces against the window and
smile.


PATTY
(CONT’D)
For God’s sake! A woman has died.
The Simpsons frown and she takes the picture.
INT. SIMPSON STATION WAGON - ON THE HIGHWAY
Bart and Lisa are looking out of the back window.
BART/LISA
».. Six... seven... eight...
MARGE
What are you kids playing?
BART
Counting game.
MARGE
That’s nice.


In a WIDE SHOT we see a suitcase fall off the Simpson car
roof and bounce down the highway.

from the car trip.


- Selma sleeps with her face pressed against the window and
her mouth wide open.


- Jailbird, in prison blues, is hitchihiking at the side of
the road. We see the prison behind him. He holds a sign
labelled "State Line or Bust.".


- Homer takes a whiz on the side of the road. He smiles
back at the camera.


- Homer zips up his pants as a couple of state troopers
approach.


- Homer is pushed into the back of the patrol car.
INT. SIMPSON STATION WAGON - LATER


Patty and Selma chain smoke in the back seat, the door
ashtrays overflow with cigarette butts.


SELMA
I can’t believe Auntie Gladys is
really gone.

PATTY
Her legend will live forever.


Homer appears in his own THOUGHT BUBBLE and talks into
Homer’s ear.


HOMER‘S THOUGHT BUBBLE
Yeah, the legend of the dog-faced
woman!

HOMER
(LAUGHING) Legend of the dog-faced


woman! Oh, that’s good.

MARGE
(FURROWED BROW) Homer, that’s very
rude of you.
HOMER
(ANNOYED GRUNT)
SELMA
Could we please stop somewhere? My
butt’s asleep.
HOMER
We’re not stopping until we get to
Mom’s Restaurant. They’ve got the
best durned food in these parts.
BART
How do you know?
HOMER
(COCKILY) I just do.


The car passes under a billboard for Mom’s Restaurant. The
slogan is "THE BEST DURNED FOOD IN THESE PARTS."


INT.
MOM‘S RESTAURANT = DAY


From the jukebox we hear the very end of "CONVOY." A
‘TRUCKER drops in a coin, pushes some buttons, and we hear
"CONVOY" begin again.


Patty and Selma are puffing away in the SMOKING SECTION.
We follow the smoke to the non-smoking booth right behind
them where the rest of the Simpsons sit in a cloud of
smoke.


We PAN across Marge, Bart, Lisa and Maggie as they eagerly
gobble down the meals. We then see Homer hunched over a
placemat marked "JUST FOR KIDS". He’s struggling to
complete a simple maze.

HOMER


Careful... almost there...


9!,

We see Homer’s pencil line slowly head into an alligator’s
mouth.


HOMER
(CONT’D)
(FRUSTRATED MOAN)


He angrily crumples up the placemat and hurls it onto a
pile of crumpled placemats.


WAITRESS
(WEARY) Another placemat, sir?
HOMER
(DIGNIFIED) Please.
LISA
While we’re waiting for our pie,
let’s take a minute to remember Great
Auntie Gladys.
MARGE
That’s a wonderful idea, honey. A
moment of silence.
They all put down their forks and concentrate.
BART’S THOUGHT BUBBLE


Bart remembers a $25 U.S. Savings bond in an envelope that
reads "From Aunt Gladys."


LISA’S THOUGHT BUBBLE

Lisa remembers old wrinkled hands pouring powdered milk
into a glass of water and stirring. A four-year-old Lisa
looks on in horror.


HOMER’S THOUGHT BUBBLE


Homer tries to conjure up the image. It fades in and out
like a faulty Star Trek beam.


10.


9F11 TABLE DRAFT 6/15/92


MARGE’S THOUGHT BUBBLE
Marge remembers a glorious sun-streaked pier. A vibrant
Aunt Gladys stands watching proudly as three young girls
jump from the pier and frolic merrily in the pond.
Marge comes out of the memory.
MARGE
Wait a minute. That was "Prince of
Tides."

The Simpsons’ station wagon passes through an industrial

"THE LUCKY STIFF" FUNERAL HOME - DAY - ESTABLISHING
We see a sign on the building which reads: "We Put the Fun
in Funeral." On the sign is a drawing of a smiling corpse
in a casket, hands behind its head.
INT.
“THE LUCKY STIFF" FUNERAL HOME - DAY


The Simpsons sit amongst other RELATIVES at the funeral.
The REVEREND delivers an emotional eulogy.


IAs


9F11 TABLE DRAFT 6/15/92


REVEREND
He was a good man. He was a kind man.
He gave to his community and asked
little in return.


An ASSISTANT WHISPERS in his ear. He looks down at the open
casket.


REVEREND
(CONT’D)
That’s a woman? Dear Lord. (NERVOUS
LAUGH) Well, I guess most of what I
said can be salvaged.

Patty approaches and takes the mike.

PATTY
Take a seat, bozo. And that "eulogy"
better not show up on the bill.


Patty grabs the edges of the podium and collects her
thoughts.


PATTY
(CONT’D)

I’1l keep this short. Gladys didn’t
like a lot of things, but I guess she
hated people most of all. She lived
alone. Died alone. I guess you could
say she was a heroine for Selma and
me.

Selma reacts.

INT. FUNERAL PARLOR -
LATER

Bart stands before the open casket, completely mesmerized.


He repeatedly lifts Aunt Gladys’s lifeless arm and drops
it. Homer pushes Bart away from the corpse.

9F11 TABLE DRAFT 6/15/92


HOMER
Don’t hassle the dead, boy. They
have eerie powers.
Homer looks down at the corpse.
HOMER’S BRAIN (V.O.)
I thought this thing was going to be
catered. Boy, am I hungry. (GETTING
CHOKED
UP) I mean I’m really, really
hungry.
Homer pounds the coffin with frustration.
HOMER
(OUT LOUD) It’s just not fair,
dammit!


Homer begins to WEEP openly. Marge consoles him and pulls
him away. Lisa approaches the coffin.


LISA
Goodbye, Great Aunt Gladys.
(SOLEMNLY) I wish I had made more of
an effort to get to know you these
last few years.

AUNT
GLADYS’ CORPSE
Don’t worry about it.

LISA

Lisa runs away in horror. Bart steps from behind the
coffin dusting his hands and CHUCKLING.

Gladys enters the frame and sits down in a chair.
AUNT

Well, take a good look. This is the
last you’ll see of me.


The framing is off and only her hair and eyes are visible
in the frame.


AUNT GLADYS
(CONT’D)
I would like to start by reading a
passage from my favorite poet, Robert
Frost. (OPENS BOOK) "Two roads
diverged in a yellow wood..."
Homer fast-forwards through the poem with a remote control.
MARGE
Homer!
HOMER
All in favor of skipping the poem?
(RAISES HAND)
Everyone but Marge raises a hand.
HOMER
(CONT’D)
(SMUGLY) Thank you.


The tape resumes. Aunt Gladys is now in frame.

AUNT
GLADYS
Now, let’s get down to business. To
Marge, I leave my collection of
potato chips that resemble
celebrities. They’re all here. Otto
Von Bismarck. Maurice Chevalier.
Right up to Jay Leno.


She holds up each chip. Each bears a remarkable resemblance
to said celebrity.


AUNT GLADYS
(CONT’D)
They were my life’s work, Marjorie.
Take special care of them.
In the back of the room, Homer is greedily stuffing the
chip collection into his mouth. His chewing slows and he
looks guilty.
AUNT GLADYS
(CONT’D)
To my dear, childless nieces Patty
and Selma, I leave my grandfather
clock and these sage words of wisdom:
Don’t die lonely, like me. Settle
down. Raise a family. And do it
now. (VOICE RISING) Now. Now! NoW!


The words hit Selma like darts. She slumps in her chair,
overwhelmed. Patty looks pleased.

He’s asleep.

You just put

admit it, it was nice to have a man
around the house. I want a father
for my child.
Patty comes up to console her.
PATTY
(TO SELMA) I know someone who cold
use a meatball pita pocket right now.
SELMA
Hold that thought. I have to say
goodbye to someone first.

The doctor hands Selma her vial of sperm, with tongs, from

Give us a minute, doctor.
SPERM
DOCTOR
(COMPASSIONATELY) Take all the time
you need.
The doctor exits.
SELMA
(TO VIAL) Well kiddo, I don’t want
you to take this the wrong way, but
I’m just not ready to commit yet.
But don’t take it personally. You
were damn near perfect.
Selma looks around to make sure no one’s looking.

So long A-10259.


The camera turns to a heart-shaped "Love American Style"
iris as Selma kisses the test tube.

(PANICKY) Doctor, my lip is stuck to
the vial!
FADE

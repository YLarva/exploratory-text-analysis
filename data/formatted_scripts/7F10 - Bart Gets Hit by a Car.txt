BART GETS HIT BY A CAR


BY
JOHN

ACT
ONE
FADE
IN:
EXT. A BUSY DOWNTOWN STREET - AFTERNOON
BART
is zooming around recklessly on his skateboard as the
credits roll. SUPER TITLE: "Episode 23: Bart Gets Hit By A
Car." A beat after this fades, Bart gets rammed by a 1948
Rolls Royce. The skateboard becomes airborne, describes
several slow loops, then throws Bart, WAILING, onto the
sidewalk. The Plymouth SCREECHES to a stop, and SMITHERS
jumps out of the passenger seat and hurries up to Bart.
Bart is lying on the ground, unconscious. The skateboard
is upside down next to him, its wheels still spinning.
Smithers bends down to look at Bart. MR. BURNS remains at
the wheel of his car, fuming.
SMITHERS
(CALLING OVER HIS SHOULDER TO BURNS) I
think the boy's hurt!
BURNS
Oh, for crying out loud... give hima
nickel and let's get going.
SMITHERS
I think he's unconscious.
BURNS
Then give him a dollar and (HONKING


HORN FOR
EMPHASIS) let's go!

SMITHERS
But, this might be serious. I think we
should call an ambulance.

BURNS
(MUTTERED CURSES)


Burns gets out of his car, SLAMS the door and walks over to
look at Bart. CAMERA MOVES IN for a closeup of Bart.


DISSOLVE
TO:
EXT. SAME SCENE - DREAM SEQUENCE


Slowly a ghostly image of Bart stands up out of his body
and looks down.


BART
Hey... that looks like me.


We hear a HUGE CHOIR of angelic VOICES singing something
glorious. At the same moment, a golden slide appears next
to Bart. He hops on. CHORAL MUSIC swells slightly as the
slide begins lifting Bart up into the sky. A polite,
though very mechanical, FEMALE VOICE is heard coming out of
a hidden speaker in the escalator. This voice continues
repeating the same message throughout Bart's ascent to
heaven.


FEMALE VOICE
(0.S.)
Please hold on to the handrail. Do not
spit over the side.
NEW ANGLE - OVERHEAD
SHOT


From high in the clouds we can see Bart swiftly but
gracefully soaring up towards the camera. He is looking
up, then down, then up again.


NEW ANGLE - ALONGSIDE
BART


Bart begins passing clouds that have PEOPLE on them. the
people are strumming harps, sleeping, reading magazines,
watching television or eating. All are dressed in white
flowing robes with fairly large white wings on their backs.
Bart gazes curiously at them as he passes. One of the
clouds has a HUGE FRONTIERSMAN ANGEL standing on an ANGEL
BEAR.
Both have large white wings. The bear is dead.

BART
(CONT'D)
(AMAZED) Jebediah Springfield!
Bart passes another cloud. It is a slightly larger one,
and has half a dozen SIMPSON LOOKALIKES on it. They are
fighting.
BART
(CONT'D)
Aunt Hortense! Great Grandpa Simpson!
Next to the Simpson cloud is a smaller cloud inhabited by
an ANGEL CAT who is smashed almost completely flat, with a
tire tread running all the way up its back.
BART
(CONT'D)
Snowball!
Bart peers over the side of the slide at the receding
earth. He can see nearly the whole planet. It looks as if
he's in orbit.
FEMALE VOICE
(0.S.)
Please hold on to the handrail. Do not
spit over the side.
Bart lets go of the handrail and spits over the side.


BART'S
POV


We see earth, far, far off in the distance. Bart's gob of
spit disappears. A beat later we hear a SPLAT.


BART
Cool!
HEAVENLY SIRENS
go off everywhere. Red lights begin
FLASHING
on the slide. The steps flatten out and Bart
begins sliding rapidly downward.
BART
(CONT'D)
Whoa!
FEMALE VOICE
(0.S.)
We told you to hold onto the handrail.


We asked you not to spit over the side.

NEW
ANGLE
From a camera mounted on the ground, we see Bart hurtling
towards the ground at frightening speeds. Just as he is
about to hit the ground, he covers his eyes with his hands,
a crack opens up in the earth. The CHOIR SINGING is
replaced by WAILS, MOANS and DIABOLICAL LAUGHTER.
NEW ANGLE - INSIDE THE CRACK IN THE EARTH
The MOANS and WAILS grow louder and the surrounding rocks
get redder as Bart plunges farther into the earth on the
slide. Bart looks around him as he passes DAMNED SOULS
sitting or standing on ledges near the escalator. He
passes NAKED PEOPLE in chains who are surrounded by fire,
groups of BEWILDERED SALESMEN still clutching their burning
briefcases, and a few SULLEN HIPPIES who are sitting on
ledges strumming their melting guitars.
FIRST
HIPPIE
(DEPRESSED. TO SECOND HIPPIE) Bummer,
man.
SECOND
HIPPIE
(DEPRESSED) Yeah. (TO BART) Hey man,
got a quarter?


Before he can answer, the slide ends and Bart is pitched
off.


BART
(STARTLED YELL)
EXT. FLOOR OF CAVERN - CONTINUOUS
The end of the slide is about twenty feet from the bottom
of the cavern. Bart falls and lands with a THUD at the
feet of a grinning DEVIL who is leaning jauntily on his
pitchfork. Bart gets up, rubs his rear end, and confronts
the devil.
BART
I'm Bart Simpson. Who the hell are


you?


TABLE DRAFT
6/19/90 PAGE 5.


DEVIL
(EVIL CHUCKLE)
BART'S
POV


We follow Bart's gaze around the cavern. It is a Simpson-y
version of Hieronymus Bosch's hell.


BACK TO BART AND THE DEVIL
DEVIL
You've earned eternal damnation for
your lifetime of evil deeds, Bart.
Spitting off the escalator clinched it.
BART
What evil deeds? I admit I stole a
couple of candy bars and cheated on a
spelling test. But that's about all
I've had time for so far. I'm only
ten.
DEVIL
(THINKING) Hmmm... it does seem a
little harsh. Let's see.
The Devil pulls out a file drawer from a rock wall, fumbles
through the contents, then pulls out a very thick, charred,
eyiln looking file folder marked "Bart Simpson". He opens
DEVIL
(CONT'D)
You've stolen three thousand, two
hundred candy bars and cheated on
thirty-nine spelling tests.
BART


Wow!


TABLE DRAFT
6/19/90 PAGE 6.


DEVIL
And that's just the tip of the iceberg.
However, according to this, you're not
due to arrive here until the next time
the Yankees win the pennant; nearly a
century from now. Sorry for the
inconvenience, Doomed One.
BART
That's all right. Hey, I make mistakes
too.
DEVIL
We know. (LOOKS UP) Ah! I see your
family is waiting for you.
Bart looks up. Huge heads of HOMER, MARGE, LISA and MAGGIE
are looking down at him. It looks like they have plunged
their heads down through the earth's crust. They look very
concerned. Bart suddenly finds himself floating up towards
the surface, Bart looks back at the devil.
BART
(A LITTLE TROUBLED) Say... uh... is
there anything I can do to avoid coming
back here? Is there some way I can
change my life?
DEVIL
(CONSIDERING) Well... you could... but
you wouldn't like it.
BART
(ACCEPTING THIS) Oh, okay. See you


later then.

DEVIL
(WAVING AND CALLING) Goodbye Bart!
Remember: Lie, cheat, steal and listen
to heavy metal music!
BART
(WAVING) Yessir!
The CAMERA TRACKS with Bart as he floats up through molten
rock, a layer of bedrock, clay, dirt, a grimy basement,
several floors of hospital rooms, through the floorboards
of his hospital room, up through his hospital bed and into
his unconscious body.
NEW
ANGLE
Homer, Marge, Lisa and Maggie are all leaning over Bart
with concerned expressions. In the middle of them is a
smartly dressed, shifty looking character named LIONEL
HUTZ.
He has his arms around Marge and Homer and is
joining the others in gazing down on Bart. Suddenly Bart
stirs and opens his eyes.
HOMER
He's awake!
MARGE
Oh, Bart! We thought for a minute
you'd gone away from us.
BART
(EAGERLY) I did go away, Mom! I was
miles and miles and miles away,
writhing in agony in the pits of Hell.
(POINTS TO EACH FAMILY MEMBER IN TURN)
And you were there! And you! And you!


And you! (POINTS AT HUTZ) You I've


never seen before.

HOMER
(TURNING TO HUTZ) Hey, yeah! Who are
you? I saw you chasing Bart's
ambulance...

HUTZ
Hutz's the name, Mr. Simpson. Lionel
Hutz, Attorney-At-Law. Here's my card.

Hutz hands Homer a business card.

HUTZ
(CONT'D)
It turns into a sponge when you put it
in water.

HOMER
Classy.

HUTZ
I'd like to talk to you about bringing
legal action against the fiend who did
this to your boy.

HOMER
Well, the fiend who did this is my
boss. And besides, the doctor says
it's just a bump on the head and a


broken finger. Nothing serious.


TABLE DRAFT
6/19/90 PAGE 9.


HUTZ
(SCOFFING) Doctors! Doctors are
idiots! There's no telling what kind
of permanent injuries he might have.
You might have to wait on him hand and
foot (POKING HOMER IN THE CHEST AT EACH
WORD) for the rest of his natural life!

The family reacts with dismayed AD LIBS.

HUTZ
(CONT'D)
That's the downside. Here's the good
part. You can cash in on this tragedy
and get a big cash settlement right
now!

HOMER
(MASSAGING HIS CHEST) Wow...

MARGE
Mr. Hutz, this is hardly the time or
place to discuss this.

HUTZ
You're right, you're right. When you
feel up to it, come over to my office
and we'll talk about it.

Grode exits and begins following a passing stretcher.

HUTZ
(FADING) Lionel Hutz, Attorney-At-Law.
What's that, a broken neck? Great!


A smiling DOCTOR HIBBERT enters Bart's room and bends over
to examine the large bump on Bart's head.


TABLE DRAFT

DOCTOR
HIBBERT
Well! We've got a nasty bump on our
head, haven't we? (FEELS BUMP)
BART
ow!
DOCTOR
And a little tiny broken finger.
(WRIGGLES BART'S BROKEN FINGER)
BART
ow!
MARGE
Is he well enough for me to start
mothering him unbearably, doctor?
DOCTOR
Better let him rest up awhile first.
BART
Will I ever be able to clean my room
again, Doc?
DOCTOR
(PATTING BART'S HEAD) Of course you
will, my boy. Sooner than you think.
BART
Dann.
DISSOLVE
TO:
INT. NUCLEAR POWER PLANT - NEXT DAY


Homer is eating a donut with LENNY in the snack area.


LENNY


TABLE DRAFT
6/19/90 PAGE 11.


I heard Mr. Burns crushed your boy.


HOMER


Yeah.


LENNY


I think you should bring that up at the


next union meeting.
HOMER


(GETTING A LITTLE ANGRY)


Yeah! If TI


wasn't so spineless, I'd march into Mr.


Burns' office right now and...


Smithers pokes his head in the door.


SMITHERS


Simpson! Mr. Burns wants you to march


into his office right now.
HOMER


Uh-oh...


INT. BURNS' OFFICE - A COUPLE OF MINUTES LATER


Homer enters the office behind Smithers. Burns is sitting
behind his desk trying to smile amiably, but the results
are grotesque. A half-dozen identical LAWYERS are standing


behind Burns. They are smiling thinly.


holds out his hand to shake.


BURNS


Burns gets up and


Ah, Simpson! At last we meet.


HOMER


Nice to meet you too, sir.


TABLE DRAFT
6/19/90 PAGE 12.


BURNS
My lawyers have advised me to pay you
for running over your child. So I've
written you out a check.

HOMER
You have? Great!

BURNS
(HANDING CHECK TO HOMER) It's a
cashier's check. For...
(IMPRESSIVELY)... One... Hundred...
Dollars! (QUICKLY) Of course you'll
have to sign a waiver, relinquishing
your right to sue and so forth...
merely a formality...

HOMER
(STUNNED) A hundred bucks?

BURNS
(IMPATIENT) Take it or leave it,
Simpson.

Homer starts to sweat nervously.

HOMER
W-well... It's a v-very generous offer,
sir. But -- well -- a hundred dollars
doesn't buy as much as it used to.

BURNS
(GRABBING CHECK ANGRILY) Very well.


Then you get nothing.


TABLE DRAFT
6/19/90 PAGE


HOMER
Well, maybe a couple of hundred...
BURNS
I have the finest lawyers in
Springfield, Simpson. (THE LAWYERS NOD
SMUGLY) If you ever try to take me to
court, they'll tear you apart.
(LAWYERS NOD SMUGLY AGAIN) Throw him
out, Smithers.
HOMER
(WITH SOME DIGNITY) You don't have to
do that, Mr. Burns. I can throw myself
out.
Homer leaves stiffly and closes the door.
INT. OUTSIDE BURNS' DOOR - CONTINUOUS
Homer, shaken and nervous, stands up against the closed
door. He is now sweating profusely. He reaches into his
pocket and pulls out the card Hutz gave him and wipes his
face with it. Homer, realizing what he's got, reads the
card which starts expanding obscuring some of the letters.
CLOSE-UP - HUTZ'S
CARD
It reads: "Attorney-at-law. As seen on TV. No case too
small. Si habla espanol. Klondike 5-Laww." The logo is
the scales of justice overflowing with money.
HOMER
Hey! Lionel Hutz...


Homer clenches his fist, defiantly thrusting it in the air.
Sweat spills down his arm from the card-turned-sponge.

Between "The Yogurt Nook" and "Gum for Less" is the law
office of Lionel Hutz.


INT. THE OFFICE OF LIONEL HUTZ - CONTINUOUS


The secretary, DELLA, is sitting at her desk reading a
magazine. Homer is there. Hutz enters.


HUTZ
Right in here, Mr. Simpson. Any calls,
Della?

DELLA
Calls?


She looks at Hutz questioningly. He surreptitiously jerks
his thumb at Homer.


DELLA
(CONT'D)
(SUDDENLY GETTING IT) Oh, calls!
Yes... uh... (LOOKS THROUGH NOTEPAD)
The Supreme Court called again. They
need your help on some "freedom" thing.
HUTZ
Tell them to sit tight. I'11 get back
to them. This way, Mr. Simpson.
INT. HUTZ'S INNER OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
Hutz indicates a chair in front of his desk and they both
sit down. Homer looks around the very ostentatiously


decorated office. There are framed diplomas all over the
walls.


TABLE DRAFT
6/19/90 PAGE 15.


HOMER
(ADMIRING DIPLOMAS) You sure have got
some education, Mr. Hutz.
HUTZ
(UNIMPRESSED WITH HIMSELF) Yes...
Harvard, Yale, MIT, Oxford, The
Sorbonne, The Louvre...
We hear a faint SIREN. Hutz automatically jumps out of his


chair, remembers Homer, then sinks suavely back into his
seat.


HUTZ
Mr. Simpson, I think you've got a good
case here. I'd like to handle it. My
fee is fifty percent of the settlement.

HOMER
(RESISTING) Fifty percent?

HUTZ
You'll be getting more than just a
lawyer, Mr. Simpson. You'll also be
getting this exquisite faux pearl
necklace -- a $99 value -- as our gift
to you.


Hutz pulls several necklaces out of his desk drawer,
untangles one, and hands it to Homer.


HOMER
(LOOKING AT NECKLACE) Well... I
dunno... You and I might have
different ideas about just how big a


big cash settlement should be.


TABLE DRAFT
6/19/90 PAGE


HUTZ
Ten million dollars.
HOMER
Whoo! I stand corrected. Ten million
bucks is A-okay!
DISSOLVE
TO:
INT. WAITING ROOM OF HUTZ'S DOCTOR'S OFFICE - NEXT DAY
Marge and Homer are standing around a little nervously in
the waiting room. Hutz is with them, rubbing his hands
expectantly. All three are looking at the closed door
marked "Examination Room". The walls of the office are


covered with diplomas like Hutz's. As Homer admires them,
we PAN several of the diplomas. We see "Mayo Klinic


Correspondence School," "Comiskey Park Medical School," I
Went To Medical School For Two Years and All I Got Was This
Lousy Diploma," "Honorary Member Christian Barnard Fan


Club," "Smooth Operator," and "Female Body Inspector."
HOMER
(ADMIRINGLY) Some education!
HUTZ
Now, we'll get a real doctor's opinion!


The door to the examination room opens and a smiling DOCTOR
comes out, looking like he is full of good news.


HUTZ'S
DOCTOR
(CHEERFULLY) Bad news!

MARGE
oh!

HUTZ'S
DOCTOR
(GRINNING) Your son is a very sick
boy. Just look at the X-Rays!


He holds up a large X-Ray of Bart's head, spikey hair and
all.

HUTZ'S DOCTOR

(POINTING) See that dark spot there?
Whiplash.
HOMER
Whiplash!
HUTZ'S
DOCTOR
And this smudge here that looks like my
fingerprint? That's trauma.
MARGE
(MURMURS DISAPPROVINGLY)
Bart is wheeled out of the examination room in a wheelchair
by a NURSE. He is in a full body cast with his broken
finger held up and out from his body by rods that are
attached to the cast on the top of his head. The cast is
contoured to the spikes of his head. He has IVs sticking
into both arms. Bart takes one look at the worried faces
around him and gets scared.
BART
Am I going to die?
HOMER
(BREAKING DOWN) Yes, son.
MARGE
(SHOCKED) Homer!
HOMER
(QUICKLY CONTROLLING HIMSELF) I
mean... no, of course you're not going
to die. Everything's fine!
BART


Will I ever play baseball again?

INT. BURNS' OFFICE - A FEW DAYS LATER


Burns is looking through a sheaf of legal-looking papers
with disbelief.


BURNS
Ten million dollars! Smithers! Who is
this Homer J. Simpson?
SMITHERS
One of your semi-skilled workers. If
you'll remember, sir, you recently
flattened his child with your car.
And then a few days ago, you tried to
bribe him.
BURNS
Oh him, how could I forget? Fire him.
SMITHERS
Uh, do you think that's wise, Mr.


Burns? I mean... think of the


headlines.
CLOSE-UP -
BURNS
He thinks.
NEWS
PAPERS
They whirl up to the camera and stop one at a time. Each
has one of the following headlines: "Burns Fires
Ungrateful Employee," "Another Smart Move By Burns," and
"Hooray For Burns." This last headline is illustrated with


a photo of Burns being carried on the shoulders of people
of all races and creeds.


TABLE DRAFT
6/19/90 PAGE 19.


BURNS


He finishes visualizing the headlines and looks at
Smithers, baffled.


BURNS
What about the headlines?
SMITHERS
The press might be critical of you for
firing the crippled boy's father so
soon after the accident.
BURNS
Well... all right then. I don't want
to seem like an ogre. (VERY SINISTER)
I'll bide my time. Let him twist in
the wind... slowly... slowly. And
then... when the papers have found
their new "flavor of the month", he'll
find out this cat has claws!
Burns raises a claw-like hand.
SMITHERS
Good thinking, sir.
INT. SIMPSON HOME - ENTRANCE HALL - SEVERAL DAYS LATER
We are looking over Marge's shoulder as she opens the front
door. Three of Bart's friends, MILHOUSE, LEWIS and RICHARD
are standing in the doorway, baseball caps in hand.
MARGE
I'm sorry, boys, but I'm afraid Bart
can't come out and play today.
MILHOUSE


We don't want to play, Mrs. Simpson.


TABLE DRAFT

RICHARD
We heard Bart got torn up into a
million pieces.
MILHOUSE
Yeah, and we want to see it.
MARGE
I'm sorry. You'll have to wait and see
Bart when he's better.
MILHOUSE
Aw, heck.
LEWIS
Who wants to see him then?
NEW
ANGLE
Marge closes the door and we follow her into the living
room. Bart is in the center of the living room in his
wheelchair. Hutz is standing next to him, adjusting one of
the bandages and then seeing how it looks. Homer, Lisa,
and Maggie are watching this procedure with interest.
HUTZ
Now, let's pretend you're on the
witness stand... (PAUSE)... How are
you, Bart?
BART
Fine.
HUTZ
(EXPLODING) Wrong!!! You are not
fine! You are in constant pain!


BART


(INTIMIDATED) I am in constant pain.

I do not know how I can go on.
LISA
I think what you're doing is wrong.
BART
I think what you're doing is wrong.
HOMER
What's wrong with it?
LISA
I think all of this is just a charade
to make Bart look more injured than he
really is.
HOMER
Paging Dr. Lisa, please report to your
room immediately.
MARGE
Well, maybe Lisa does have a point,
Homer. I mean Dr. Hibbert has been our
family physician for years and he

Your honor, my client has instructed me

important he is, and that he is not
like other men.
Burns leaps to his feet.

kids as I want!
The judge BANGS his gavel and frowns at Burns. Burns sits
down. A few of the SPECTATORS are nodding in agreement

BART
Maybe.

Bart looks at Homer and Hutz. They both violently shake

Good. Proceed, Mr. Hutz.

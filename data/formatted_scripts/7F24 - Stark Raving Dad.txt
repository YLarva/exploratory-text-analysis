LISA


(SOFTLY) Bart... Bart... Hey, Bart.


No response. Lisa shakes him but he does not stir.


Finally, she holds his nose closed with her fingers.


a beat, Bart springs up in bed, GASPING for air.


BART
(GROGGY) Lisa? What time is it?
(ALARMED) Something’s wrong!
(GUESSING) Dad died!
LISA
No, no. He’s fine.
BART
Well, what do you know? I’m relieved.
LISA
Bart, my birthday is in two days. I/m
going to be eight years old. It’s a
big number -- almost double digits.
BART
Well, enjoy it while you can.
Everything changes when you hit the big

BART
Sorry, this old timer does ramble on
sometimes, don’t he?

LISA
Bart, I have very few people in my life
who truly seem to care for me. I need
an occasional sign from you that you
too are aware that we have the same
dubious genes coursing through our
veins.

INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - KITCHEN - BREAKFAST
MAGGIE
is in her high chair. Bart is reading the back of a
box of Frosted Krusty Flakes -- there is an ad aad the
"Krusty Hotline -- 1-909-0-U-KLOWN."
MARGE
Bart, I want you to watch Maggie while
I get the laundry.
BART
(FROM BEHIND THE BOX) Can do.


MARGE
picks up the laundry basket and heads for the laundry
room. Bart immediately sneaks over to the phone and dials.


KRUSTY
(V.0.)

Hi kids! You/’ve reached the Krusty

Hotline. If you haven’t asked your

parents’ permission, naughty naughty!

But Krusty forgives you! Two dollars

for the first minute, fifty cents for

each additional minute. (LONG LAUGH

THAT DOESN'T
STOP)
During Krusty’s LAUGH, Maggie grabs the chain hanging down
from the ceiling fan. She hoists herself out of the high
chair and swings out of frame on the chain, like Tarzan --


Bart does not notice. Krusty finally concludes his long
LAUGH.


FINAL DELIVERY

KRUSTY

A new message every day.
MARGE

(SHOCKED) Maggie!
Marge has now entered with the laundry to find Maggie
hanging from the blades of the ceiling fan. Marge gets her
down.
MARGE
Bart, I asked you to watch your sister!
BART
I tried to stop her but she overpowered
me.


An angry Maggie SPITS her pacifier into Bart’s face. HOMER
runs in wearing pants, but bare-chested.


HOMER
(PANICKY) Who stole my shirt? Who
stole my shirt?

MARGE
I washed it.

HOMER
(WARMLY) Oh thank you, Marge, oh,
you’re always so -- (SHRIEKS)


Marge has pulled his white shirt out of the basket -- it is
now pink. Marge gives a puzzled MURMUR.


FINAL DELIVERY
12/06/90 5.


HOMER
(CONT’D)
(SCARED) Marge, I can’t wear a pink
shirt to work. Everybody wears white
shirts. If I wear a pink shirt, I
won’t be exactly like everyone else!
MARGE
Now Homer, don’t panic. You have
Plenty of white shirts.
HOMER
Oh, gimme! Gimme! Gimme! Gimme!


Homer grabs the laundry basket, and frantically digs
through it. He pulls out one pink shirt after another.


HOMER
(CONT’D)

(FRANTIC) Oh no... Pink. Pink! PINK!

(SOBBING) It’s all over, Marge. It’s

all over.

Marge regards a large pink pair of Homer’s underwear.

MARGE

I don’t know how this could have

happened.


Bart reaches into the basket, pulls out a red baseball cap,
and sets it jauntily on his head.


BART
Ah, my lucky red hat. Clean as a
whistle!

HOMER
You! You did this to me!


Homer strangles Bart who CHOKES.

INT. NUCLEAR POWER PLANT - MORNING


We see a sea of white-shirted WORKERS entering the plant.
In the midst of them is one pink shirt.


BURNS
(V.O.)
Wait a minute, go back. Why is that
man in pink?
WIDEN
to see BURNS and SMITHERS are watching the workers on
a color monitor. Smithers hits a button -- tape rewinds,
then freeze-frames on the crowd. Smithers ZOOMS IN on
Homer’s unhappy face.
SMITHERS
Oh, that’s Homer Simpson, sir. He’s
one of your boobs from Sector 7-G.
BURNS
Simpson, eh? Well, judging by his
outlandish attire, he’s some sort of
free-thinking anarchist, an individual
non-conformist. Smithers, bring me
this latter day Sacco and Vanzetti.
SMITHERS
I’11 call security, sir.
BURNS
Excellent. These color monitors have


already paid for themselves.

INT. POWER PLANT -
CORRIDOR
Homer walks down the hall. CO-WORKERS all WHISPER, point
to him, and shake their heads. He enters the coffee room
to see LENNY and CARL.
LENNY
Hey Homer, we saved you a doughnut.
CARL
It has pink frosting!
Carl holds up a pink doughnut. They LAUGH.
HOMER
Mmm, thanks -- It looks... (CATCHING
ON) Hey, wait a minute! Just because
I’m wearing a pink shirt, it doesn’t
mean I’m some kind of a... a pink
doughnut-eater! (LICKING LIPS)
Although it is tempting --


Homer grabs the doughnut as two burly SECURITY GUARDS
enter.


GUARD
#1
(SHARPLY) Drop that doughnut.


Guard #2 slips out of his jacket and covers Homer’s shirt
with it. They hustle Homer away.


INT. POWER PLANT - ROOM 101


Homer sits in a chair with the guards behind him. He is
being grilled by Burns, Smithers and DR. MARVIN MONROE.


HOMER

my son just threw his red hat in with


the white laundry...

BURNS
All right, Comrade. If you are an
American, what number did Peek-a-Boo
Veach wear?

HOMER
Who?

BURNS
First baseman for the Cleveland
Spiders! Take him away!

SMITHERS
You know, Mr. Burns, his body cavity
search revealed nothing and we must
have x-rayed him a hundred times.
Maybe he’s telling the truth.

BURNS
Or perhaps you two are in cahoots.
Smithers, I seem to recall you had a
penchant for bell-bottom trousers back
in ‘79.

SMITHERS
Uh, sir, that was my costume from the


plant production of H.M.S. Pinafore.


FINAL DELIVERY
12/06/90 9.


BURNS
Oh, yes, of course. Your spirited
hornpipe stole the show, as I recall..
(RE HOMER) Now Doctor, what shall we
do about our free wheeling fop over
here?
MONROE
Well, Monty, it used to be that
establishing a patient’s sanity took
weeks, sometimes months of tedious
research. That’s all changed, thanks
to the "Marvin Monroe Take- Home
Personality Test." Twenty simple
questions that will determine just how
crazy or (AIR QUOTES) meshuggenah,
someone is.
Marvin Monroe hands Homer a questionnaire.
INT. SIMPSON HOUSE
= MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
Marge is at the mirror putting hairspray on her huge
bouffant. The can SPUTTERS out and she puts it down next
to a few other empties. She pulls a new can out of a
drawer and SPRAYS when Homer enters with his questionnaire.
HOMER
Honey, do me a favor. Fill out this
form.
MARGE
(READING) Homer, this is an intimate
psychological profile. I can’t fill


this out for you.

LISA’S BEDROOM
Lisa is writing at her desk. Homer KNOCKS and enters.
HOMER
Lisa, you like homework. Could you
fill out this form for me?
LISA
Well, all right -- if you listen to the
poem I just wrote.
HOMER
(ANNOYED GRUNT) O-kay.
LISA
(PASSIONATELY) I had a cat named Snowball --
She died, she died!
Mom said she was sleeping --
She lied, she lied!
Why oh why is my cat dead?
Couldn’t that Chrysler hit me, instead?
(PAUSE, THEN)
I had a hamster named Snuffy --
He died, --

No deal.


He leaves.

Son, it’s no different than the time

BART
Oh, yeah.

CLUCK
their tongues. Homer sits off in a corner.
HOMER
(HOPEFUL) So, did I pass?
BURNS
(CHUCKLES) No.
MONROE
Homer, I’m afraid you have a Monroe
Meshuggenah Quotient, or M.M.Q. of 800
-- roughly equivalent to a rabid mole.
I’m afraid we’re going to have to have
you committed.
HOMER
What?
MONROE
Ah, you no longer have to pretend to be
normal.
HOMER
Well, that’s a bit of a relief. DoTI

Burns nods as a signal to GUARDS, who grab Homer and
restrain him, as he SCREAMS.

Homer is flanked by two large ORDERLIES. He is seated,
facing a PSYCHIATRIST, who gives him a Rorschach test, with
black inkblots that vaguely resemble Homer’s descriptions.
HOMER
The devil with his fly open.
PSYCHIATRIST
Right...
Next inkblot.
HOMER
Chicken a la king.
PSYCHIATRIST
Good...


The psychiatrist holds up the next inkblot -- it looks
exactly like a silhouette of Bart.


HOMER
(LUNGING) Arrghh!
The orderlies restrain him.
HOMER
(CONT’D)
This isn’t fair! How can you tell
who’s sane and who’s insane?
PSYCHIATRIST
Well, we have a very simple method.
He stamps Homer’s hand "INSANE."

Homer is thrown into a cell -- a spare dormitory style room
with two cots. The door is SLAMMED and locked. Suddenly,
from out of the shadows, comes Homer’s CELLMATE, a huge,
hulking, 300-pound white man. The cellmate speaks with
Michael Jackson’s voice.

Bart and Lisa are watching TV. ON SCREEN we see the Itchy
and Scratchy logo, followed by a title card: "Bang The Cat
Slowly."
ON
TV
Itchy and Scratchy wear conical party hats. We see
balloons and a "Happy Birthday Scratchy" banner. Itchy
puts a lit bomb in a box, then uses Scratchy’s tongue for a
ribbon, wrapping it around the box and tying it into a bow.
Scratchy retracts his tongue, swallowing the package. The
bomb EXPLODES, blowing his head off. Scratchy’s party hat
lands back on his headless shoulders; then the head lands,
impaling itself sideways on the hat’s point.
BACK TO
SCENE
Bart and Lisa LAUGH.
LISA
(COYLY) Bart, does this cartoon remind
you of something?
BART
It does bring to mind the classic
scalping scene from "Scratchy Goes

INT. NEW BEDLAM - REC ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON
Michael takes Homer through a sparsely decorated rec room
right out of Cuckoo’s Nest: MEN in bathrobes play poker or
watch TV; a bearded OLD MAN does a waltz without a partner.
They stop at a table where a MAN stares blankly into space.
MICHAEL
Homer, this is Floyd. (WHISPERS) He’s
an idiot savant. Give him any two
numbers and he can multiply them in his
head, just like that. (SNAPS FINGERS)

him to get a lobotomy, do you?

Bart is playing with a paddleball in the living room. He

ashamed to admit it to another guy, but
I’m... scared.
MICHAEL
We all get scared once in a while.
Maybe I can help you.
Michael SINGS Homer a lullaby to the tune of "Ben."
MICHAEL
(CONT’D)
(SINGING) Homer, the two of us need
look no more / We both found what we
were looking for / With a friend to
call my own / I/11 never be alone /
And you my friend will see / You’ve got
a friend in me.


Homer, smiling, drifts off to sleep -- then begins SNORING
loudly. Michael picks up a MONKEY DOLL from his dresser.


MICHAEL
(CONT’D)
(TO DOLL) Bubbles, it’s going to be a
long night.

A female DOCTOR is leading the session, attended by Homer,
Michael, DAVE, a thirty-ish man in a bathrobe, and SEVERAL
OTHERS.
DOCTOR
Please feel free to express yourselves.
In these sessions we want you to feel
relaxed and uninhibited.
Camera PULLS BACK through a one-way mirror to see the
inmates are monitored by SEVERAL DOCTORS with notepads.
Several instruments, with charts and needles, are operating
in the background.
BACK TO
SCENE
DAVE
Okay, So I was working at an insurance
company, right? Huh! Youngest VP in
the history of the firm. Okay? The
job was my life. Then one Monday
morning, (CLEARS THROAT) I got up and
I couldn’t leave the house. I just
couldn't.
HOMER
Was the door locked?
DAVE
No, I just couldn’t face what was out


there.

HOMER
Was it raining?
DOCTOR
No, Homer. Dave suffers from
agoraphobia -- a fear of open areas and
crowds. Please, Dave, go on.
DAVE
Thank you. Anyway, that day I knew I
just couldn’t make that long drive to
work.
HOMER
Were you out of gas?
INT. NEW BEDLAM - ADMITTING OFFICE - MORNING
Marge is talking to the psychiatrist who admitted Homer.
PSYCHIATRIST
Mrs. Simpson, I’m sorry but your
husband suffers from a persecution
complex, extreme paranoia, and bladder
hostility.
MARGE
Doctor, if you just talked to him for
five minutes without mentioning our
son, Bart, you’d see how sane he is.
PSYCHIATRIST
You mean there really is a Bart? Good


Lord!

the shoulder.


PSYCHIATRIST
Oh, Mr. Simpson, you’ve got a visitor.
HOMER
(ANNOYED GRUNT)
Homer turns to see Marge standing there.
HOMER
(CONT’D)
Marge!
MARGE
Oh, Homie.
Marge and Homer embrace. She peppers him with KISSES.
PSYCHIATRIST
Mr. Simpson, after talking to your
wife, we believe you’re no threat to
yourself or others.
HOMER
That‘’s the most flattering thing
anyone’s ever said to me. Could I have
it in writing, please?
PSYCHIATRIST


Of course.

Michael shakes Homer’s hand.
MICHAEL
I’m proud of you, Homer.
HOMER
Thanks a lot, Michael. You really
helped me get through this. If you
ever find your marbles, come visit us.
MICHAEL
Well, how about today? I’m only here
voluntarily.
HOMER
You are? Why?
MICHAEL
Well, back in 1979, I got real
depressed when my "Off the Wall" album
just got one lousy Grammy nomination.

smother you with kisses.
BART
Homer, whatever they’ve got you on, cut
the dose.
HOMER

Isn/t that cute -- he’s heard of you!

Aye carumba!


PULL BACK
to reveal EVERYONE in town is gathered on the
front lawn, some spilling into the street. FANS hold a
banner reading "WE LOVE MICHAEL!" A MAN in a rainbow wig
holds a "John 3:16" sign. KENT BROCKMAN is doing a live
news report. The state FOOTBALL TEAM, the Capital City
Incumbents, is there. A HELICOPTER touches down on the
lawn: MAYOR DIAMOND JOE QUIMBY gets out and crosses to a

This is the most exciting thing to
happen to our fair town since the Dalai
Lama visited in 1952. And so, I hereby
declare that Route 401, currently known
as the Dalai Lama Expressway, will
henceforth be known as the Michael
Jackson Expressway.


There is a STIR in the crowd as the Simpson car pulls up.
Homer gets out and waves to the crowd.


KENT
BROCKMAN
(TO NEWS CAMERA) And here’s the father
of the family who, it turns out, was
just released from a mental hospital.
HOMER
Thanks everybody! It’s great to be
sane.
A crowd starts CHANTING "We want Michael! We want
Michael!" Homer’s cellmate slips on dark sunglasses and
sneaks out of the car unnoticed. Homer points him out to
the crowd.
HOMER
(CONT’D)
Here he is! Here’s the guy you want to
see.
"Michael" waves shyly to the crowd. Disappointed at not
seeing the real Michael Jackson, they BOO and begin to
MUTTER.

crowd starts to disperse. Bart’s friends all chew him out.


MILHOUSE
You owe us Michael Jackson.
KEARNY
Don’t ever show your face around here
again, ya tool.
MARTIN
Bart, do me a favor. I want you to
look up this one word. Pariah.
As they leave, Homer approaches.
HOMER
Out of respect for your mother, I won‘t
kill you till she’s asleep.

LISA
Bart, the entire town is howling for
your blood, and before I join them I
have one question. Today’ is my
birthday -- did you get me anything?
I’m afraid to ask.
BART
You know, maybe you should trust that
instinct and not ask.
LISA
*
I thought so. Oh, Bart, you...
She LEAVES, SOBBING.
INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - BATHROOM - A LITTLE LATER

HOMER’S HAND
He is at the sink, trying to scrub the "INSANE" stamp off

~- LISA’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS


Lisa is writing a letter. Michael walks past the open
door, but stops short to listen.


LISA

Dear Bart, I am using the stationery
Mom and Dad gave me for my birthday to
inform you that we are now brother and
sister in name only. Perhaps if a
professional so advises, I will give
you a hug at some far distant family
reunion, but rest assured it will be


purely for show.

Bart sits moping on his bed, kicking his feet, head in
hands.


MICHAEL
Hey, Bart.

BART
Hey... you.

MICHAEL


Bart, when I was a kid, I didn’t have
much money. So you know what I did
when my sisters’ birthdays rolled
around?
BART
Stiffed ’em?
MICHAEL
No. I wrote them a song. To show that
I cared.
BART
I can’t write a song. I’m only ten.
MICHAEL
Only ten? When I was your age I had
six gold records.


Bart pulls a copy of the "Thriller" album from his bookcase
and points to the cover photo.


FINAL DELIVERY
12/06/90 40.


BART
Hey, Looney Tunes, this is what Michael
Jackson looks like. You look like a
big fat mental patient.
MICHAEL
You’d be amazed how often I hear that.
BART
Just leave me alone.
MICHAEL
*
Look boy, either Michael Jackson is
some guy working in a recording studio
in LA or he’s here with you willing to
work on this song. It’s your choice.
So long.
Michael starts to exit.
BART
Wait, wait, Michael! You go sit at the
piano and I’11 boil some coffee.
MONTAGE


Bart and Michael work into the night, a la Rodgers and
Hammerstein.


1) Michael and Bart sit at the piano.
MICHAEL
Bart, we’ve got to get to your real
feelings about your sister.
BART


I don’t have any.


FINAL DELIVERY
12/06/90 41.


MICHAEL
Well, let’s go look at her. Maybe that
will help.


3) Bart and Michael sit in the treehouse and spy at Lisa
in her bedroom.


MICHAEL
Ah, she looks sad.

BART
That’s cause she knows you’re looking
at her.

LISA
Although I am aware you are looking at
me, I would look exactly the same even
if you weren’t.


4) Michael PLAYS an introductory flourish on the piano,
then Bart sings from a sheet:


BART
(TO COLONEL BOGEY MARCH) Lisa, her
teeth are big and green / Lisa, she
smells like gasoline / Lisa, da da da
Deesa / She is my sis-ta, her birthday
I missed-ta.

MICHAEL
No.


Bart crumples it and throws it into a pile of discarded
songs.


5) Later that night. More crumpled up songs lie on the
floor. Michael and Bart are at the piano, looking very
tired.


FINAL DELIVERY
12/06/90 42.


MICHAEL
Bart, think. What happens to you when
you turn eight?

BART
Well, your training wheels come off
your bike.

MICHAEL
Good. That’s good. (SINGING AND
PLAYING) The training wheels come off
your bike / You start to notice boys
you like...hee, hee, hee.


Michael PLAYS a snatch of the song, then adds a little
riff.


BART
You’re just putting that in because
it’s commercial.


Michael looks embarrassed. They exchange a smile. At this
moment they join as colleagues. *

BART
Yes, so it’s still technically your
birthday in the Philippines. I hope
you like your present. And a-one, and
a-two, and a one, two, three, four --
Michael rolls in the piano and performs a song with Bart.
Their SONG is a tribute to turning eight. Michael dances;
he does a flashy move with his trademark fedora; Bart
copies it using his lucky red cap. Marge, Homer and Maggie
enter to enjoy the performance.
LISA
(EXCITEDLY) Bart, oh Bart. This is
the best present I ever got.
EXT. SIMPSON HOUSE - CONTINUOUS *
The PAPERBOY, delivering the Springfield Shopper with the
headline, “Michael Jackson Hoax -- Everyone Mad At Local

BART
Hey, Michael. What happened to your


voice?


FINAL DELIVERY
12/06/90 44.


LEON
This is my real voice. My name is Leon
Kompowski and I’m a brick layer from
Patterson, New Jersey. All my life I
was very angry until one day I just
talked like this. All of a sudden
everybody was smiling at me, and I was
only doing good on this earth, so I
kept on doing it. To make a tired
point. Which one of us is truly crazy?

HOMER
Not me. I got this. (POINTS TO THE
CERTIFICATE ON THE
WALL)

LEON
Well, take it easy, Homer.

HOMER
Yeah, goodbye pal. Hey, do you miss
being that other guy?

LEON
(BARITONE) You know something, Homer,
it’s not that much different.


Leon walks down the street, singing off key in his baritone
voice.

SMITHERS
(V.O.)
It’s a breakthrough product, sir:
scientifically formulated to rinse
clean with no oily deposits.
BURNS
(V.O.)
(BORED) Hot dog!
INT. MR.
BURNS’ WASHROOM - CONTINUOUS
MR. BURNS
sits in his lavish private washroom. SMITHERS is
shampooing his hair. Burns is reclining with his head ina
washbasin as in a beauty salon. Smithers finishes
massaging the suds in and starts to rinse them out.
SMITHERS
And it’s mild enough to use every day.
BURNS
(TIRED) Isn’t life grand?


A single tear runs down Burns’ face.

SMITHERS
What’s wrong sir, did I get some in
your eyes? The shampoo specifically
said "No More Tears".

BURNS
A lovely promise, but one beyond the
powers of a mere shampoo.

Smithers looks troubled.

SMITHERS
Sir, I feel there is something you’re
not telling me? Perhaps, you'd feel
more comfortable talking to Snappy the
Alligator.

BURNS
(COYLY) Maybe.


Smithers produces an alligator hand puppet.


SMITHERS
(USING PUPPET) Hello, Mr. Burns.
BURNS
Snappy, do you know what weltschmerz
means?
SMITHERS/SNAPPY
Yes, it’s a German expression meaning


"ennui or world weariness."


BFO9 FINAL DELIVERY

BURNS
Uh huh. You know, it’s hard to
imagine, but I was once a barefoot boy
with cheek of tan. I dreamed of cattle
drives, grand slam homeruns and wiping
out nations with the stroke of a pen.
The puppet nods.
SMITHERS/ SNAPPY
Well there’s still time for all those
things, sir.
BURNS
Is there? Controlled nuclear fission
is a demanding mistress, Snappy.
SMITHERS/SNAPPY
So you feel resentful towards the
plant.
BURNS
Yes, yes, exactly! (SOLEMNLY) You
know, maybe it’s time I sold the old
girl.
The puppet and Smithers’ jaws drop.
INT. POWER PLANT - WORK AREA


HOMER
is at the candy machine. He puts in a dollar bill and
the machine rejects it.


HOMER


(MOANS) Oh, what do they want!


8FO09 FINAL DELIVERY 5/31/91 4


Homer looks at the bill. We SEE it is a crumpled old bill
with a huge chunk missing from one corner. It’s taped
together in the middle. Burns and Smithers walk by. Burns
has a towel wrapped around his head.
BURNS
(SADLY) Maybe a nap will boost my
spirits.
SMITHERS
I’1l get that whale song cassette that
you like, sir.
Smithers walks up to Homer.
HOMER
It’s not fair! A man devotes his whole
life to this plant and now this. (SOBS)
SMITHERS
I know how you feel, Simpson. I’ve
never seen Mr. Burns so depressed.
HOMER
(IGNORING HIM, SOBS) Uh-huh.
Homer carefully tries to smooth out the dollar bill across
his knee. He puts the bill into the machine again and gets
excited as it starts to feed.
SMITHERS
People think that because he’s rich and
powerful and cruel, he doesn’t have
feelings like other men. But he does.
He loves every man jack of us. And you
know what? I bet he wouldn’t sell the


plant for a hundred million dollars.


The bill is rejected again.


8F09 FINAL DELIVERY 5/31/91


HOMER
(ANNOYED GRUNT) Mr. Smithers, do you
have change for a dollar?
SMITHERS
(HANDS HIM CHANGE) Good, good. Try to
eat something.
INT. POWER PLANT - WORK AREA


Homer is sitting at his post, eating his candy bar, when
the phone RINGS.


HOMER
Homer Simpson here.
INTERCUT


With a small, dirty office occupied by an unhealthy-looking
man.


BROKER
Homer, it’s your stockbroker. Your
stock in the power plant just went up
for the first time in ten years.

HOMER
I own stock?

BROKER
Yes, all the employees got some in
exchange for waiving certain
constitutional rights.

HOMER


So how much did it go up?


By


8F09 FINAL DELIVERY


BROKER
Wait a minute. Let’s not do that yet.
The book says we have to make a little
small talk before you get down to
business. (RAPID FIRE) Everybody
alive?
HOMER
(RAPID FIRE) Yeah...
BROKER
Like any sports?
HOMER
Sure...
BROKER
Ever go dancing?
HOMER
Not any more...
BROKER
We should get together sometime.
HOMER
That’d be great.
BROKER
There. Now we trust each other.
HOMER
Well... how are you?
BROKER
(COUGHS) Near death. I’m renewing my


notary license on a weekly basis.

8F09 FINAL DELIVERY 5/31/91 7.


HOMER
Uh-huh. So what’s my stock up to?
BROKER
Let me punch that up on the computer.
He opens his newspaper and looks at the tables.
BROKER
(CONT’D)
Twenty five cents a share.
HOMER
What should I do?
BROKER
Well, let me put it this way. You’ll
get twenty-five dollars if you sell
now.
HOMER
Sell! Sell! Sell! (HANGING UP) Woo hoo!
Twenty-five bucks!
Homer dreamily pictures what he can do with the money --
getting a haircut; happily driving his car thru a carwash;
buying a hammer with a $25 price tag.
HOMER
(OOH’S, AH’S, ETC)
INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME
Bart is sitting in front of the TV, watching ITCHY and
SCRATCHY, LAUGHING. On screen, UP ON title card, “House of
Pain". Itchy, dressed as a carpenter, has Scratchy’s four
limbs nailed to a two-by-four in a house under
construction. He is HAMMERING a nail into Scratchy’s skull.
Scratchy grimaces in pain, then loses consciousness, his
tongue hanging out, as the nail penetrates his brain and
comes out the back of the board. On the nail, Itchy hangs a
picture of himself with Scratchy on a fishhook like a prize
fish.


MARGE
runs in from the kitchen.


8FO9 FINAL DELIVERY 5/31/91 8.


MARGE
Bart! Bart! Turn to the financial
channel! Aunt Patty says our stock
is skyrocketing!
Bart pushes the remote control. SCOTT CHRISTIAN on the
financial channel has a mortise over his shoulder
displaying the Burns company logo, a stylized family
holding hands around a mushroom cloud.
SCOTT
CHRISTIAN
Unconfirmed takeover rumors have pushed
Burns Worldwide from one eighth to
fifty-two and a quarter...
Marge punches some numbers into a calculator.
MARGE
(GASPS) Your father’s stock is worth
fifty-two hundred dollars!
BART
Wow, fifty-two hundred smackers.
Bart dreamily imagines what he could buy with the money.
A) Bart is driving a monster truck with $5,200 painted on
the window. The side of the truck reads "BAD BOY BART".
He RUNS OVER a car, flattening it.
B) Bart lies behind a large truck labeled "FROSTY CHOCOLATE
MILKSHAKES". The truck POURS liquid like a cement truck


into his open mouth. His stomach is grotesquely bloated.


C) Bart is flying around with a jet pack on his back. PULL
BACK
to reveal he has written "EAT MY SHORTS" in the sky.

MOE’S TAVERN - AFTERNOON


Homer strides in.


8F09 FINAL DELIVERY


MOE
Hey, Homer. Wanna Duff?
HOMER
(SMOOTHLY) No, I’d like a bottle of
Henry K. Duff’s Private Reserve.
MOE
(SHOCKED) Are you sure? Cuz once I


open the bottle there’s no refund.


Homer SLAPS down a twenty dollar bill on the bar.


HOMER
For your information, I just made a


cool twenty-five dollars playing the


market. Buy low, sell high, that’s my


motto. I may just quit my job at the
power plant and become a full-time


stock market guy.


At the mention of the power plant, HANS and FRITZ, two
strangers in the bar, look up at Homer. He notices then.


Their glasses are still half-full.
HOMER
(CONT’D)
Have a Duff, boys!
HANS


(GERMAN ACCENT, FRIENDLY) Oh, thank


you. My English is not perfect, but I


have to tell you your beer is like


swill to us. Do I have that right? I am


saying that only a swine would drink


this beer.


5/31/91 9.


8FO9 FINAL DELIVERY 5/31/91 10.


FRITZ
(GERMAN ACCENT) Yeah, but thank you
anyway.

HOMER
Hey, you guys aren’t from around here,
are you?

HANS
Ech, nein. We are from Germany. He is
from the East. I am from the West.

FRITZ
I had a big company and he had a big
company. Now we have a very big
company.

HANS
Very big. We are interested in buying
the power plant. Do you think the
owner would ever sell it?

HOMER
(VERY CONFIDENT) Well, I happen to know
that he won’t sell it for less than 100
million dollars.


Hans and Fritz open a briefcase full of money. They look
pleased.


HANS
Zer guten! We’1ll still have enough


left to buy the Cleveland Browns.

INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Marge, PATTY, SELMA and LISA are watching the TV. Over
MUSIC, the financial channel is showing stock tables. Burns
Worldwide is featured as the "Big Gainer"; it closed at 52,
+51 7/8 for the day. Marge puts her hands to her face.
MARGE
It’s the miracle we’ve been waiting
for.
BART
What are we going to spend it on?
PATTY
(TO SELMA) Homer’s probably buying some
magic beans with it right now.
MARGE
We’ll have a savings account. We’ve
never had one. Kids, I think
everything is going to be okay from now
on.
Homer BURSTS IN the door, excited. He notices the TV turned
to the stock channel. The "Market Diary" table is on
screen.
HOMER
Hey... hey!
MARGE
(CONT’D)
Oh, Homer!
HOMER
You heard?
MARGE


We heard! Isn’t it wonderful? We have


some great plans for that money.


8FO9 FINAL DELIVERY 5/31/91 12.


HOMER
(GUILTY CHUCKLE) Well, I’m afraid I had
some great plans, too.
MARGE
What do you mean?
HOMER
I spent it on beer.
SELMA
(TO PATTY) Surprise surprise.
MARGE
(REALLY MAD) You spent fifty-two
hundred dollars on beer?
HOMER
Fifty-two hundred dollars? What are
you talking about?
Marge points to the TV set. The "Big Gainer" card is on
again, with Burns Worldwide closing at 52. Homer’s face
twists in horror as he walks over and stares at the TV, his
nose against the screen.
HOMER
(CONT’D)
(MOANS) What? (SCREAMS) I sold it all
for twenty-five bucks.
Bart kicks Homer in the ass.
HOMER
(CONT’D)
(CALMLY) Thanks boy, I deserved that.
BART
Come on everybody. It makes you feel
better.


Homer slumps to the floor.


8F09 FINAL DELIVERY 5/31/91 13.


PATTY AND
SELMA
Homer sits with his face in his hands. His head covers the
bottom half of the TV screen. On the top half, the title
"Big Loser" is visible over Homer’s head.
PATTY
(TO SELMA) Big loser.
SELMA
(TO PATTY) That’s news?
BACK TO
SCENE
Marge starts to CRY.
MARGE
Oh no, no.
LISA
Oh, Dad. I feel so bad for you. You’re
going to live the rest of your life
with the accusing looks on our faces
and the anchors on our hearts.
HOMER
(HUGGING HER) Oh, thanks for
understanding, honey. If I had a
favorite kid, it would be you.
EXT. NUCLEAR POWER PLANT - PARKING LOT - NEXT DAY
Homer sadly DRIVES UP and gets out of his car. A Porsche
ZOOMS
into the spot next to him, with the license plate
"LOADED." CARL gets out in a sharp suit.


CARL


Hey, Homer.


8F09 FINAL DELIVERY 5/31/91 14.


HOMER
Did you buy this car with your stock
money?
CARL
Sure did. And the great thing about it
is everybody got rich. No one’s left
out!
HOMER
(MOANS )
Homer’s CO-WORKERS PULL UP in sports cars with vanity
plates, "JACKPOT" "ME RICH" and "BUY LOW." CHARLIE DRIVES


UP
in a Deusenberg with a scarf around his neck and riding
gloves.


CHARLIE
Wait till you see Lenny. He just got
back from the plastic surgeon.
LENNY
walks up, his smiling face tight and youthful.
CARL
Jeez Lenny, looks like you got the
works.
LENNY
Well it started out as an eye tuck, but
the stock kept going up.
A WORKER
leans out of the back of a limo.
WORKER


Hey, come here, Mr. Burns is on TV.


They all pile into the back of the limo to watch the TV.


8FO9 FINAL DELIVERY 5/31/91 15.


ON
TV
Burns is getting out of a car and heading towards a
restaurant. Reporters including KENT BROCKMAN gather
around him clamoring, "Mr. Burns, Mr. Burns!".
KENT
BROCKMAN
Mr. Burns, we’ve heard that a German
consortium has offered to purchase the
plant. Any comment?
BURNS
(ANGRY) You’1l see the Statue of
Liberty wearing lederhlosen before you
see Germans running my plant!
KENT
BROCKMAN
Well then, sir, why are you meeting
with them?
BURNS
So I can look Uncle Fritz square in the
monocle and say nein.


PULL BACK
to SEE the plant workers watching on the TV in
the limo. They CHEER.

Burns and Smithers walk into the restaurant. The "Hungry
Hun" German restaurant has a sign featuring a spiked helmet
with a turkey leg impaled on it.
INT. RESTAURANT - A LITTLE LATER

Whoo! oooh, oooh, Whooo!
He does a victory DANCE then sits back down.
BURNS
(CONT’D)
I grudgingly accept.
EXT. RESTAURANT - A LITTLE LATER


Burns and Smithers and the Germans exit the restaurant.
Kent Brockman is doing a live editorial.


KENT
BROCKMAN
So in this era of "Anything for a buck
or a yen or a Deutsch mark or a
guilder," it’s nice to know that
Montgomery Burns is one American who
kept America for Americans.


Burns walks up with his arms around Hans and Fritz.


8F09 FINAL DELIVERY 5/31/91 17.

EXT. NUCLEAR POWER PLANT - DAY
As the press SNAPS photographs, the Germans hand Burns a
six-foot long check for 100 million dollars. A smiling
DIAMOND JOE QUIMBY
looks on.
BURNS
Now, don’t worry. I think you’1ll find
that these two gentlemen are as
American as apple pie! Hans and Fritz,

QUIMBY

The CROWD MUTTERS as the German flag goes up one of the

A group of about TEN WORKERS, including Homer, Lenny, Carl

Danish, waiting for the new boss.
LENNY
Those lousy Germans can’t fire me. I’m
the only one who knows how to unjam the

CARL
Well, they can’t fire me. I’m the only

HORST
(FRIENDLY) Guten morgen, I am Horst.

the lovable Sergeant Schultz on Hogan’s
Heroes.
The workers MURMUR.
INT. MR.
BURNS’ OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
Mr. Burns is at his desk. His belongings are packed into

HORST
What is the best way to an efficient
plant?


The employees look at each other and shrug, AD-LIB "Beats

HORST
(CONT’D)
Happy workers who feel secure at their
jobs. So let’s get to know each other
better. Do we have any alcoholics
among us?

A few hands sheepishly go up.

You’1l be given a six-week treatment at

A drop falls from the ceiling. It lands in a pot on the

Against N-Plant Strikers", "Seven Arrested in Plant
Protest" and "Burns Honored For Community Service".
BURNS
(SIGHS)
Mr. Burns hears muffled TALKING from a nearby room. He
pushes a button marked "Smithers" and a side door SLIDES
open. It reveals Smithers in his cramped, tiny office. on


his desk is a set of tapes marked "Sycophantic German". A
TAPE DECK

I wanted to give you something to
remember me by. And I know you’ve

Burns holds up a photo of himself and Elvis which resembles
the famous picture of Elvis and Nixon.

HOMER
Marge, it’s not the money. My job is
my identity. If I’m not a safety

Homer is asleep face down on the uncompleted puzzle. A few
pieces are banged together. Bart in his bathrobe, stands

HOMER
Huh? What?
Homer lifts his head -- several pieces are stuck to his


cheek. He DROOLS and several more pieces come out of his
mouth.


INT. POWER PLANT - COFFEE AREA - LATER
Homer is standing idly with other workers. He wears a
Safety Inspector badge. He sees Horst approach and snaps
into action.
HOMER

HORST
Homer, could we have a word with you?


HOMER


(SCARED) No.


8F09 FINAL DELIVERY 5/31/91 26.


HORST

badly. My English is, how you say...
inelegant. I meant to say, may we have

HOMER

HORST
Once again, I have failed.
He consults a phrase book.

INT. POWER PLANT - INTERVIEW ROOM - A LITTLE LATER


A sign on the wall reads "We Care". Fritz is looking at
Homer’s file. It’s completely blank.


FRITZ
Homer, we’ve been looking through your
records and we don’t feel these files
tell the whole story.

HORST
You’ve been safety inspector for two
years. What initiatives have you


spearheaded in that time?


8FO9 FINAL DELIVERY 5/31/91 27.


HOMER
Uh... all of them?
Fritz and Horst exchange a look.
HORST
(CONT’D)
I see. Then you must have some good


ideas for the future as well.


HOMER
I sure do!
A long silence.
FRITZ
Such as...
HOMER


Well, ah, I wish the candy machine
wasn’t so picky about taking beat-up
dollar bills...
Fritz and Horst stare at Homer.
HOMER
(CONT’D)
.».. because a lot of workers really
like candy.
HORST
(PATRONIZING) We understand Homer.
After all, we are from the land of
chocolate.
HOMER
Mmm. The land of chocolate...
Homer falls into a reverie.

EXT. THE LAND OF CHOCOLATE - CONTINUOUS
We SEE what looks like an Alpine Village made entirely out
of chocolate. Chocolate Easter Bunnies are hopping around.
In the background we see a giant Hershey Kiss mountain. In
one area it’s raining malted milk balls. Homer walks down
the street taking bites out of everything he passes: the
light post, a mail box, a chocolate dog, etc. He stops
short at a chocolate shop.
HOMER
Wow. Chocolate -- half price!
He walks happily into the store.

Fritz and Horst are staring at Homer. He is sitting with

FRITZ
Mr. Simpson...
HOMER
(CONTINUES SINGING) La la la...
FRITZ
Mr. Simpson...
Homer wakes up.
HOMER
Oh, oh, oh. I’m sorry. We were

INT. POWER PLANT - A LITTLE LATER
Homer is back at his console.
HOMER
(TO LENNY, CONFIDENT) I think I did
pretty good in there.
CARL
Yeah, you know those Germans aren’t so
bad.
LENNY
Sure, they’ve made mistakes in the
past, but that’s why pencils have
erasers.
HORST
(V.O.)
(OVER PA) Attention workers. We have
completed our evaluation of the plant.
Various WORKERS look up anxiously.
HORST
(V.O.) (CONT’D)
We regret to announce the following
lay-offs, which I will read in
alphabetical order. (BEAT) Simpson,

ACT_THREE
FADE
IN:
INT. SIMPSON HOUSE -
KITCHEN
CLOSE UP - CAN OF GENERIC BRAND CARROT CAT FOOD
As it SPINS on the can opener, we can read it has an 88
percent ash content. Bart puts the food in a dish. The cat
tries some, makes a face and goes over to Homer’s plate. It
eats his food as Homer stares dully at it, not moving.
Marge enters and we see her very awful hairdo. The cylinder
sags and has degenerated into a kind of Y-shape.
BART
(NOTICING HAIR) Aye carumba!
MARGE
Now, Bart, Lisa did a wonderful job on
my hair and we saved forty dollars for
the family. We all have to pull
together till your father gets a new
job.


Lisa is sitting at the table. She holds up an orange-
green-and-white, snowball-like object to show Marge.


LISA
I made a new bar of soap by squeezing
all our little soap slivers together.
MARGE
That’s very clever.
BART
And today, instead of buying comic
books, I just read ‘em and left ’em in


the store.

8FO9 FINAL DELIVERY 5/31/91


MARGE
Hmmm, you shouldn’t do that.

LISA
My jump rope broke, but I just tied it
back together.

MARGE
That’s good, Lisa.

BART
(SMUG) I didn’t take a bath today and I
may not take one tomorrow.

MARGE
I want you to take baths, Bart.


Maggie puts her pacifier on the table, then SUCKS her
thumb.


HOMER
(MOANS) Oh, this would never have
happened if I wasn’t such a bad safety
inspector.
Homer is poking a fork in the toaster. SPARKS come out.
HOMER
(CONT’D)
(MOANS) Oh what’s the matter with this
thing.


The toaster is plugged into a huge octopus outlet that is
smoking and SPARKING.


HOMER
(CONT’D)
No problems here.
MONTAGE


A.) Mr. Burns is playing bocce in the park with some old
men. He aims a shot while JASPER coaches hin.

8FO9 FINAL DELIVERY 5/31/91 32.


JASPER
That’s right, Burnsie... keep the wrist
supple... throw it, don’t aim it...


Mr. Burns heaves the ball with a GRUNT. It falls far short
of the target. The old men LAUGH at Mr. Burns.


BURNS
This is my park! Get out!
They all walk off, still LAUGHING.
JASPER
(CHUCKLES) It was worth it.


B.) We see Homer in line at the UNEMPLOYMENT OFFICE,
labelled as such. A CLERK waits on him.


CLERK
Have you been actively looking for
work, sir?

HOMER
Nah.

CLERK
(UNDER HIS BREATH) Let me explain.
This is just a little charade we go
through. You say, "Yes," I give you
the check.

The SUPERVISOR walks by.

SUPERVISOR
I heard that. No coaching. You’re
fired.

CLERK


(TO HOMER) Thanks a lot.


8F09 FINAL DELIVERY 5/31/91


The clerk steps from behind the counter and stands in line
behind Homer.


Cc.) Smithers in his office is on the phone with Burns.
SMITHERS
(ON PHONE) This place has really gone
to hell, Mr. Burns. It’s a crime what
they did to your office.


He looks over at the office. A sign clearly marks it as a
day-care center. There are several CHILDREN happily


playing in it.
INTERCUT
INT.
BURNS’ MANSION
BURNS
(A LITTLE LONELY) Listen, Smithers, you
caught me at a bad time but my folk
guitar class has been cancelled for
tonight. Would you like to get
together for a drink?
SMITHERS
Would I!
BURNS
Fine. I gotta go. See you at six.
An UNSEEN PERSON puts a mouthpiece into Burns’ mouth.
Burns advances towards the sparring partner, putting up his
dukes a la John La Sullivan.
BURNS
(CONT’D)
You’re going down, my friend.
BOXER


Yes sir, Mr. Burns.


G.) INT. POWER PLANT -

8F09 FINAL DELIVERY 5/31/91 34.


We see Smithers and the Germans are at various spots in the
plant, seeing the bad condition it is in. Horst GRUNTS as
he examines the photos.

ON
PHOTOS

1) A worker is handling plutonium with gloves that stick
through a glass wall. We see a large chunk is missing from
the glass.


2) The fire lane is being blocked by a car which is up on
blocks.


3) A family of raccoons is living inside an instrument
panel.


EXT.
BURNS’ MANSION - PRIVATE APIARY


Mr. Burns is wearing a beekeeping suit as he inspects the
hives in his private apiary.


BURNS
That’s right... gather the nectar, my
little drones, and make the honey.
Honey for your children.


Burns dips a finger into the honey, and then puts it into
his mouth.


BURNS
Fools! (EVIL LAUGH)
Smithers walks up, not wearing a beekeeping suit.
SMITHERS
Ready for that drink, sir?
BURNS
Just a second, Smithers. Let me
introduce you to the gang. (POINTING
AT
BEES) That’s Buzz. That’s Honey.
And you see that queen over there? Her


name is "Smithers."


8F09 FINAL DELIVERY 5/31/91 35.


SMITHERS
Ha, ha. That’s very flattering, sir.
But we should go. Several bees are
stinging me.
INT.
MOE’S TAVERN - EVENING
Homer looks despondent. The phone RINGS. Moe answers it.
MOE
(INTO PHONE) Moe’s Tavern. Moe
speaking.
INTERCUT
With Bart, on the phone in the Simpson kitchen.
BART
(INTO PHONE) Oh yes, I’m looking for a
Mr. Uage. First name... Ross.
MOE
(INTO PHONE) Oh just a minute. (CALLING
OUT) Ros-Suage, ros-Suage. Could
somebody check the kitchen for Ros-
Suage?
The barflies LAUGH.
MOE

BART

8F09 FINAL DELIVERY 5/31/91


MOE
Listen you, when I get a hold of you,
I’m gonna use your head for a bucket
and paint my house with your brains!
BART
(LAUGHS AND LAUGHS)
INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
Marge enters. Bart hangs up quickly.
MARGE
Bart, I want you to go down to Moe’s
Tavern.
BART
Uh, why?
MARGE
I need you to bring your father home,
and for some reason their line is
always busy.
Bart looks sick.
INT.
MOE’S TAVERN - A LITTLE LATER
Bart sneaks in the door and skulks around, looking for
Homer among the patrons. Homer has his head down on the
bar.
BART
Excuse me, I’m looking for --
MOE
Wait a minute. I know that voice.


BART

Moe picks him up and sits him on the bar.
MOE
(CONT’D)
If it isn’t little Bart Simpson! I
haven’t seen you in years.


A very relieved Bart smiles and nods. He proudly points to
his passed-out father.


BART
That’s right. That’s my pop!

MOE
Ah, little Bart... we hear all about
your monkeyshines.

Moe elbows Bart in the ribs.

MOE
(CONT’D)
(CONSPIRATORIAL) Bet you get into all
kinds of trouble he don’t even know
about. Am I right? Huh? Am I right?

BART
(CAN’T RESIST) Yeah, well, I make some
crank phone calls.

MOE
(MUSSES BART’S HAIR) That’s great!
(LAUGHS) Hey, would you sing that old
song you used to sing for me?

BART
(A LITTLE EMBARRASSED) Moe, for you...

EXT. STREET -

Mr. Burns’ car rolls slowly down the street. Mr. Burns
points out the window. They’re passing Moe’s Tavern.


BURNS
Look! A blue-collar bar! Oh,
Smithers, let’s go slumming!


The car PULLS UP to Moe’s. As Smithers scurries to open
the door for Mr. Burns, we hear SINGING from within.


INT.
MOE’S TAVERN - CONTINUOUS
Bart is up on the bar, doing an exaggerated school play-
type of dance as he sings, skipping and swaying his head
from side to side. The barflies CLAP.
BART

(SINGING) Every teddy bear who's been

good is sure of a treat today/ There’s

lot of marvelous things to eat, and

wonderful games to play/ beneath the

trees, where nobody sees/ they‘’1ll hide

and seek as long as they please/

Today’s the day the teddy bears have

their picnic!


Bart bows to APPLAUSE from Moe, who hands him a chocolate
bar.


MOE
He’s a pip, this one is!


Burns and Smithers enter and pause at the door. They see
the crowd still LAUGHING and CLAPPING for Bart.


8FO09 FINAL DELIVERY 5/31/91 39.


BURNS
Ah, the mirthless laugh of the damned.
Hold your nose, Smithers, we’re going
in!
Burns sits next to a now-revived Homer, who turns and
reacts with shock at seeing Burns but says nothing. Burns
pats Homer on the back as Moe comes over.
BURNS
(CONT’D)
(TO SMITHERS) Watch me blend in. (TO
MOE) Barkeep, some cheap domestic beer
for me and my "buddy" here.
HOMER
I’m not your buddy, you greedy old
reptile!
BURNS
Smithers, who is this saucy fellow?
SMITHERS
Homer Simpson, sir. Sector Sieben-
gruben -- I mean, Sector 7G. Recently
terminated.
HOMER
That’s right. I lost my job so that you
could have another 100 million dollars.
Homer SHOVES Burns as he speaks.
HOMER
(POINTED) Let me ask you something.
Does your money cheer you up when


you're feeling blue?


8F09 FINAL DELIVERY 5/31/91 40


BURNS
Yes.
HOMER
(POINTED) Oh. Well, does it buy you a
present on your birthday?
BURNS
Indeed it does.
HOMER
Okay, bad examples. So let me ask you
this, does your money ever hug you when
you come home at night?
BURNS
(SHAKEN) Why, no.
HOMER
And does it ever say, "I love you?"
BURNS.
(SHAKEN) No, it doesn’t.
HOMER
(SING-SONG) Nobody loves you. Nobody
loves you. You‘’re old and you’re ugly.
Nobody loves you. Yea, yea, yea yea!
Nobody loves you...


As Homer SINGS, the barflies AD LIB encouragement, "Way to
go", "That’s telling him", etc.


BURNS


You can’t talk to me like that!


8F09 FINAL DELIVERY 5/31/91


HOMER
Hey, I’m an unemployed guy who just
drank a lot of beer. I can do anything
I want.
The barflies CHEER.
BURNS
Good heavens, Smithers! They’re not
afraid of me anymore!
The entire bar starts RAZZING Burns. Bart walks up to him.
BART
Hey Mr. Burns, did you get that letter
I sent?
BURNS
Letter? I don’t recall any letter...
BART
That’s because I forgot to stamp it.


He STOMPS on Burns’ foot. The bar bursts into gales of
LAUGHTER.


MOE
(LAUGHING) Ah, that kid slays me.
BURNS
That was no accident. Let’s get out of
here.


Smithers is carrying Burns out of the bar. The Barflies
and Homer start SINGING.

Hey hey hey / Goodbye -- Na na nana /

What good is money if you can’t inspire
terror in your fellow man?
(DETERMINED) I’ve got to get my plant
back!
INT. POWER PLANT - BOARD ROOM
Hans lays out a balance sheet before Fritz. He’s looking
through a window to the plant. Suddenly the ceiling of the
area he is viewing COLLAPSES.
HANS
Gott in himmel! wWho’d have thought a
nuclear plant could be such a
deathtrap.
FRITZ
Even though it will cost us another
hundred million dollars, we must put
safety before profit and repair this
plant.
Mr. Burns BURSTS in the office, followed by Smithers.
Burns drops to his knees, after Smithers puts down a
handkerchief.
BURNS
Please sell me my plant back! Please,
please, please!


The Germans look at each other, hopeful.


8FO9 FINAL DELIVERY 5/31/91 43.


HORST
Isn’t this a happy coincidence? You
are desperate to buy, and we are
desperate to sell. (FRIENDLY SMILE)
BURNS
(EVIL SMILE) Desperate, eh? (TO
SMITHERS) Advantage, Burns.


Burns writes a figure on a sheet of paper and gives it to
the Germans.


BURNS
(CONT’D)
This is my offer. I think you’1ll find
it’s most unfair, but those are the
breaks.

HANS
But Mr. Burns, this is half of what we
paid you.

BURNS
That’s my final offer, take it or leave
Les

HORST
(OMINOUS) All right, Mr. Burns. You
win. But beware. We Germans aren’t
all smiles and sunshine.

BURNS

Burns shoos a bunch of KIDS out of his office. He wakes up
a SLEEPING CHILD.


BURNS
(CONT’D)
You too. This is a place of business,
not a Peewee flop house!

The LITTLE BOY leaves CRYING.

SMITHERS
Your orders, sir?

BURNS
Restore my office. Cancel all repairs.
And rehire that chap who sassed me in
the bar.

SMITHERS
Homer Simpson, sir?

BURNS
Yes, Smithers. I keep my friends close
and my enemies even closer. He/’1l
slowly regain his confidence as the
months and years drift by, blissfully
unaware that the sword of Damocles is
dangling just above his head.


Burns picks up a letter opener and dangles it ominously
above his desk.


8F09 FINAL DELIVERY 5/31/91 45.

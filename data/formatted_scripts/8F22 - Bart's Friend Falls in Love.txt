INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - DAY
MUSIC: "RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK" THEME


Bart, wearing his lucky red cap, is at Homer’s dresser. He
is eyeing a glass jar full of change which glints. Bart
carefully picks up the change jar. Suddenly we hear a
RUMBLING
sound. HOMER rounds the corner in his underwear.


HOMER
Why you little...


Homer chases Bart down the hall and trips over a baseball
glove with "Bart" written on the thumb. Homer goes
tumbling end over end almost crushing Bart a la the boulder
from "Raiders". Bart grabs his books and maneuvers down the
stairs followed by Homer -- over the cat, under the dog,
past MAGGIE. Maggie fires a suction cup dart gun as Bart
runs past. We see the darts hit the wall like bullets
following Bart.


INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS


Bart runs into the kitchen, hops onto the table and grabs a
blade on the ceiling fan. He turns 180 degrees as Homer
runs past off screen.


HOMER
(0.S.)
What the... (ANNOYED GRUNT)


Bart falls to the floor and runs off in the opposite
direction.


INT. SIMPSON HOUSE
= GARAGE - CONTINUOUS


The garage door is open. We see the school bus waiting
outside. Bart runs into the garage followed by Homer who
pushes the automatic garage door button. The door starts
closing. Bart runs out, sliding under the garage door. He
sees his lucky red cap which is still under the garage
door. Bart reaches in and plucks his cap out just as the
door shuts. Homer SLAMS into the door making a dent in it.

BART
(CHUCKLES)
EXT.
STREET
Bart jumps on the bus and stands on the steps with the door
open as it pulls away. Bart cockily waves his hat at
Homer. We see Homer running out still in his underwear,
shaking his fists and GRUNTING like an angry tribesman.
INT. SCHOOL BUS -
DAY
Bart sits down next to Milhouse.
MILHOUSE
Hey, Bart, look at this. My dad took
me to Circus of Values last night and
said I could get anything I wanted.
Milhouse holds up an oversized fortune teller billard ball.
BART
Cool! An oversized novelty billard
ball.
MILHOUSE
(HOLDING UP OVERSIZED PLASTIC 8-BALL)


Yeah, you shake it up and it tells the


future.

BART
Really?

MILHOUSE
Uh-huh.

BART


(GRABBING BALL) Will I pass my English
test?


Bart shakes the ball. He reads the answer in the window.


8F22 FINAL DELIVERY 10/18/91 3.


BART
(CONT’D)
(READING) "Outlook not so good."
Wow! It does work!

MILHOUSE
Let me try. (SHAKING 8-BALL) Will I
get beat up today? (READS 8-BALL)
"All signs point to yes."

Milhouse turns to see Nelson standing behind him.

NELSON

That ball knows everything. (UGH)
Nelson punches Milhouse in the face.

BART
(TO MILHOUSE, CONSOLING) That wasn’t
so bad. At least he was quick and
professional. Hey, I got a good one.
(TALKS TO 8-BALL) Will Milhouse and
I be friends till we’re toothless old
men with hair coming out of our ears?
(READING BALL, SURPRISED) "Don’t
count on it." Will Milhouse and I be
friends when we’re high school
dropouts living off of Uncle Sucker?
(SHAKES, READS 8-BALL) “It looks
doubtful." (WORRIED) Will Milhouse
and I be friends at the end of the


day?

INT. SPRINGFIELD ELEMENTARY - PRINCIPAL SKINNER’S OFFICE -
CONTINUOUS


SAMANTHA, a sweet looking ten year-old girl with braces,
sits in a chair facing PRINCIPAL SKINNER. Her file sits on
his desk.
SKINNER
Samantha I’ve always been suspicious of
transfer students... Other principals
try to unload problem cases that way...
Lord knows I do.
SAMANTHA
I’m a good student, Principal Skinner.
SKINNER
(SKEPTICAL) Yeah sure, and they told
me I’d get a big parade when I got back
from ‘Nam. Instead they spat on me. I
can still feel it searing. So, let’s
just see what the permanent record has
to say, shall we?.
He picks up her record.
SKINNER
(CONT’D)
Hmm... no detention... fairly good
attendance record... Oh, I see you beat
that bed wetting problem in the second


grade.


8F22 FINAL DELIVERY 10/18/91 5.


SAMANTHA
That’s in there?

SKINNER
(CHUCKLES) Don’t worry. The only
people who will ever see it are your
principals and future employers.


INT. SPRINGFIELD ELEMENTARY -
KRABAPPEL’S ROOM - A LITTLE
LATER


Mrs. Krabappel is handing back the tests.
MILHOUSE
Hey Bart, how’d you do on the test?
BART
To those who doubt the power of the
Magic 8-Ball, I say "Behold my "F!"


Bart holds up the test. The grade reads: 36, F, "Very
poor, even for you."


Principal Skinner enters with Samantha.
SKINNER
(CLEARS THROAT) Attention class, I
have a new student for you.
MRS.
KRABAPPEL
Great, another student. Just keep


packing ‘em in, Seymour.


The class


8F22 FINAL DELIVERY 10/18/91 6.


SKINNER
I think we should discuss this later,
Edna. (TO CLASS) Now, it’s never easy
to come to a new school, so let’s make
her feel right at home. Please say a


big elementary school hello to Samantha


Stinky.
LAUGHS.

SAMANTHA
Stanky.

SKINNER


Oh, right. How embarrassing for you.


Well, goodbye.


Skinner exits.


MRS.
KRABAPPEL
I’m sure this is a little scary for
you, dear.

SAMANTHA
(SMALL VOICE) Uh-huh.

MRS.
KRABAPPEL
So why don’t you stand up in front of
the class and tell us about yourself?
I‘1l be grading you on grammar and


poise.


Samantha stands in front of the class. During her speech,
Bart rolls his eyes, bored. Milhouse stares at Samantha,


smitten.


8F22 FINAL DELIVERY 10/18/91 7.


SAMANTHA
We just moved here from Phoenix. My
dad owns a home security company. He
came to Springfield because of its high
crime rate and lackluster police force.
All my friends are back in Phoenix, and
this town has a weird smell that you’re
all probably used to -- but I’m not.
MRS.
KRABAPPEL
It’1l take you about six weeks, dear.
INT. SPRINGFIELD ELEMENTARY - PLAYGROUND - LUNCHTIME
Milhouse is sitting eating lunch. Bart walks up to hin.
BART
Hey, Milhouse, would you like a wet
willie?
MILHOUSE
Sure.
Bart licks his finger and twirls it in Milhouse’s ear.
MILHOUSE
(CONT’D)
Eew!
BART
(CHUCKLING) Victim number four.
(CALLING OFF) Hey, Lewis, can I
interest you in a wet willie?
LEWIS
(V.O.)


Sure!


8F22 FINAL DELIVERY 10/18/91 8.


Bart exits. Milhouse eats his lunch for a beat. Suddenly
a kick-ball flies into frame and hits him in the head,
knocking off his glasses.
MILHOUSE
(MOANS)
He looks around for his glasses.
MILHOUSES
P.O.V.
The world looks extremely blurry.
MILHOUSE
(V.0.)
When I find out who hit me with that
ball...
Milhouse puts his glasses on. The world comes into focus
including Samantha standing in front of him holding the
ball.
MILHOUSE
(V.0O.)
(STUNNED) Wuh.


She smiles at him.


INT. SPRINGFIELD ELEMENTARY -
KRABAPPEL’S ROOM - AFTER
LUNCH


On the blackboard is written: "SEX EDUCATION"
MRS.
KRABAPPEL

Class, in order to explain why your
hormones will soon make you an easy
target for every smooth talking
Lothario with his own car and tight
jeans, I will now show a short sex
education film.


She turns to two thin, pale-looking boys.


8F22 FINAL DELIVERY 10/18/91 9.


MRS. KRABAPPEL
(CONT’D)
Ezekiel and Ismail, in accordance with
your parents’ wishes, you may step out
into the hall and pray for our souls.


The two boys exit the room. Mrs. Krabappel puts a tape in
the VCR.


ON
TV
An early 70’s sex education movie comes onscreen.
TROY
McCLURE stands in a doctor’s office wearing a wide
tie, flair pants and other 70’s fashions.
TROY
Hello, I’m actor Troy McClure. You
kids might remember me from such
educational films as "Lead Paint:
Delicious But Deadly," and "Here Comes
the Metric System!" I’m here to
provide the facts about sex in a frank
and straightforward manner. And now,
here’s "Fuzzy Bunny’s Guide To


You-Know-What."


A cartoon comes up on the TV. We see a rabbit dressed in
70‘s striped bell bottoms and a white turtleneck.


TROY
(CONT’D)

This is Fuzzy Bunny. About a year ago
he noticed his voice was changing, he
had terrible acne, and had fur where
there was no fur before. He also
noticed Fluffy Bunny!


Fuzzy Bunny walks up to a cute female Bunny. She has a
mini-skirt and go-go boots.

BART
Bo-ring!

who is staring at Milhouse. She smiles.


ON
TV
We see shots of the following:
TROY
(V.0.)

Fluffy and Fuzzy went to the park...
the ice cream social... the boat
show... and various other wholesome
activities. And they never ruined
their fun by giving in to their
throbbing biological urges. Then came
the big day. Fluffy and Fuzzy got
married!


We see Fluffy in a wedding gown and Fuzzy in a yarmulke,
smashing a glass.


ON MILHOUSE AND
SAMANTHA


They are staring at each other. Between them Bart looks
bored.

In back of the room Mrs. Krabappel is smoking a cigarette
while watching the movie.


MRS.
KRABAPPEL
She’s faking it.
ON
TV
We see Fluffy and Fuzzy in bed, after sex, both smiling.
TROY
(V.O.)
The most satisfying part of the night
was knowing that they waited.


We see Fluffy and Fuzzy reach for post-coital carrots and
put them in their mouths.


ON
TV


We see Fluffy in a hospital bed holding lots of little
rabbits as Fuzzy looks on.


TROY

Nine months later, Fluffy gave birth to
fourteen beautiful bunnies. Eight
survive.
ON
TV
Back to Troy in the doctor’s office.
TROY
And now that you know how it’s done,
don’t do it.
"The End" fills up the screen. The movie goes off.
Mrs. Krabappel turns on the light and walks to the front of
the classroon.
MRS.
KRABAPPEL


(BORED) Any questions?


8F22 FINAL DELIVERY 10/18/91 12.


NELSON
Mrs. Krabappel, how come you don’t live
with Mr. Krabappel?
MRS.
KRABAPPEL
Because Mr. Krabappel chased something
small and fluffy down a rabbit hole.
Samantha raises her hand.
SAMANTHA
How do we know when we fall in love?
She looks at Milhouse.
MRS.
KRABAPPEL
Oh, don’t you worry. Most of you will
never fall in love and marry out of
fear of dying alone. (CHUCKLES)
BART
How would I go about creating a
half-man, half-monkey type creature?
MRS.
KRABAPPEL
I’m sorry, that would be playing God.
BART
God shmod, I want my monkey-man.
EXT. SCHOOL -
AFTERNOON


The school bell RINGS. The kids are exiting. Milhouse
walks up to Samantha.


MILHOUSE
Ah, that’s a nice dress.
SAMANTHA


My dad makes me wear it. I hate it.


8F22 FINAL DELIVERY 10/18/91 13.


MILHOUSE
Well, I hate it too. Your dad must be
a real jerk.
SAMANTHA
I love my dad.
MILHOUSE
Huh? (TO SELF) Gee, everything I’ve
heard about women is true. (THEN)
Uh -- can I walk you home?
SAMANTHA
Okay.
INT. BUS - THAT
MOMENT
Bart is sitting in a seat by himself.

Everybody on, but no shoving. (BEAT)
Just kidding, you can shove all you
want.
Otto starts the bus.
BART
Hey, wait Otto-man, you can’t leave.
Milhouse isn’t here yet.
oTto
Sorry Bart-dude, no time. After I drop
you kids off, I’m gotta go model naked
for a community college art class!

MILHOUSE
I’ve brought friends to this treehouse

Yeah, but never a girl. What if I want

SAMANTHA
Maybe I should go.

BART
No, that’s okay. You can stay. You

Hey, Lis, can I borrow some of your

Good evening. Did you know that
thirty-four million American adults are
obese? Taken together, that excess

Okay, Milhouse... I’11 trade your

Deal! Next on the trading block,

Samantha looks at her watch.
SAMANTHA

As they separate, we see Milhouse’s glasses are fogged up.
SAMANTHA

My dad thinks I’m having my braces
examined.
MILHOUSE
Well, you kinda-sorta are.
(CHUCKLES)
Samantha gives Milhouse one long last KISS and runs out.
BART
Milhouse, we’re living in the age of
cooties. I can’t believe the risk
you're running. Besides, what’s so


great about kissing?


8F22 FINAL DELIVERY 10/18/91 21.


MILHOUSE
Bart, it’s not just the kissing. A lot
of it is waiting to kiss. You know
like when you open an Eskimo Pie and
you wait just a little bit for it to
melt?

BART
But she doesn’t melt.

weight without dieting or lifting a

HOMER
I’d say "You’re a lying scumbag." Why
sweetie?
Lisa holds up "Eternity Magazine."
LISA
According to Eternity Magazine you can
lose weight through subliminal
learning. That’s where an idea is
subtly implanted in your head without
you even knowing it.
HOMER
Oh Lisa, that’s a load of rich,
creamery butter.
Lisa opens the magazine.

So long pal. We’ve had a lot of great
memories.


DREAM
DISSOLVE
TO:


Homer’s memories of his stomach.

MUSIC: "MEMORIES" BY PAUL ANKA

EXT. POOL -
DAY

Homer floats with his gut sticking out of the water.
French fries are resting on a plate on his stomach. Homer
munches on them.


INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM


Maggie sits on Homer’s stomach. Homer flexes his stomach,
bouncing Maggie up and down in the air. Homer CHUCKLES.


EXT. SPRINGFIELD -
PARK

A big banner reads: "ANNUAL 4TH OF JULY PARADE". A bare-
chested Homer has a big smile painted on his belly and eyes
painted on his nipples. He lowers a gigantic bowler over
his head and shoulders, hiding his arms, and struts down
the street to the CHEERING of the crowd.


DREAM
DISSOLVE
TO:


THE
PRESENT
Homer smiles fondly then gets into bed. He puts on
headphones and turns on the tape. NEW-AGE MUSIC comes out.
Homer starts SNORING. We hear Marvin Monroe’s voice on the
tape.
MARVIN MONROE
(V.0.)

Hello, this is Doctor Marvin "Let’s

build your vocabulary" Monroe. Now

let’s get started. A: abattoir:


slaughterhouse. "The cow was


slaughtered in the abattoir."

EXT. SIMPSON HOUSE - MORNING - ESTABLISHING
INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
The family is eating. Homer grabs a fistful of bacon.
MARGE
Homer, has the tape reduced your
appetite?
HOMER
(MOANS) lamentably, no. My
gastronomic rapacity knows no
satiety.


He shovels food into his mouth. Marge and Lisa exchange a
look.


LISA
Don’t worry, dad. You can’t expect
these tapes to work overnight.
INT. SCHOOL BUS -
DAY
The bus pulls to a stop. Bart and Lisa get on.
INT. BUS
= CONTINUOUS
Bart looks over and sees Milhouse and Samantha sitting
together. Bart looks over and sees the only empty seat is
next to MARTIN. He sits down.
BART
Hey Martin.
MARTIN
Bart? This is the first time anyone
has ever sat next to me since I
successfully lobbied to have the
school day extended by twenty


minutes.


8F22 FINAL DELIVERY 10/18/91 28.


BART
Listen Martin, right now I’m looking
for a friend who won’t leave me for a
girl.
MARTIN
That’s me. I’m just as unpopular with
the ladies as I am with the chaps.
BART
(QUICKLY) Yeah, right. Anyway... do
you want to do something after school?
MARTIN
It’s a date. (TO BUS) Everyone, Bart
and I would like to announce that we
are friends!


The bus LAUGHS. Bart pulls his lucky red cap over his head
in shame.


INT.
MARTIN’S ROOM - THAT AFTERNOON
A neat, nerdy bedroon.
MARTIN
Now Bart, would you care to listen to
me play the lute?
BART
(DUBIOUS) Uh, sure.


Martin pulls a lute down from the wall. He puts on a
feathered cap.


MARTIN
(SINGING) "Come home my Bonnie


Warrior,

Outside Martin’s window we see Bart, running for his life.
INT. POWER
PLANT


A DONUT MAN
is delivering donuts. Homer picks up a donut
and addresses it.


HOMER
Oh, jelly donut. What gustatory
delights lurk beneath thy crusty
carapace? (TAKES BITE) Ah! Pure
ambrosia!
DONUT
MAN
(TOUCHED) At last! Someone who
appreciates what I do!
He hugs Homer.
INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY


Bart, Milhouse, and Samantha all sit on the couch watching
television. Milhouse holds Samantha’s hand.


ON
TV


An Itchy and Scratchy cartoon comes on. The title card
reads "I’m Getting Buried in the Morning." Scratchy and
Mrs. Scratchy are getting married in church. Itchy, the
priest, is wearing a broad-brimmed black hat. Scratchy
kisses the bride. Itchy pulls off the hat and throws it at
Mrs. Scratchy like "Odd Job" in "Goldfinger." The hat
slices through her neck and her body falls to the floor.
Scratchy, holding Mrs. Scratchy’s head in his hands, looks
horrified as the hat flies back into frame, slicing his
head off.


CUT
TO:


Itchy driving the wedding car with Scratchy and Mrs.
Scratchy’s heads tied to the bumper a la tin cans.


8F22 FINAL DELIVERY 10/18/91 30.


BACK TO
SCENE

Bart is hysterical with LAUGHTER. Milhouse and Samantha
look at Bart uncomfortably. He almost stops laughing, then
bursts out LAUGHING again.

INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT


Homer climbs into bed with Marge. He puts the tape and
headphones on his pillow.


MARGE
I don’t know if that tape is working.
You ate three desserts tonight.

HOMER
Forbearance is the watchword. That
triumvirate of Twinkies merely
overwhelmed my resolve.

MARGE
(PUZZLED) There’s another thing I’ve
been wanting to talk to you about...

HOMER
Tut tut, gentle Marge. Your housefrau
raiment cannot conceal your
pulchritude. For here in the boudoir,
the gourmand metamorphasizes into the
voluptuary!

MARGE
(FRUSTRATED) What in God’s name are
you talking about?

He KISSES her passionately on the cheek.

MARGE

Oh. (PLEASED MURMUR)


8F22 FINAL DELIVERY 10/18/91


She turns off the light.
EXT. SPRINGFIELD GOOGOL-PLEX THEATER - DAY
In front of the theater and stretching down the block is a
long line of KIDS, TEENAGERS, and some weird ADULTS waiting
to enter. Bart, Milhouse, and Samantha stand in line.
Behind them is a poster reading "Space Mutants VII: Vivez
Les Mutants!" The poster features a mutant in a beret,
holding the Eiffel Tower in one tentacle.
SAMANTHA
Why can’t we see "Rollerblade High"?
It’s got the two best Coreys in it.
MILHOUSE
Yeah, Bart, the space mutants always
give me nightmares.
BART
Aw, c/mon. The Space Mutant movies are
all great. Except for number three.
That’s the one Stallone directed.
Milhouse and Samantha exchange a look and follow Bart in.


INT. THEATER
= CONTINUOUS


The theater is filled up with people. Bart sits next to
Milhouse and Samantha.


ON MOVIE
SCREEN


A mustachioed French man in an ascot is making out with a
woman in a Peugeot. She pulls away from him suddenly.


Reo FRENCH MAN
What is wrong, Simone? You react to me
as if I were a bottle of improperly


chilled wine.


31.


8F22 FINAL DELIVERY 10/18/91


SIMONE
Jean-Jacques, I heard a noise. It
sounded like a space mutant.
FRENCH
MAN
Not to worry. Our military sent those
mutants packing like so many offended
American tourists. Now, let love rule
the day.
A mutant appears behind then.
FRENCH MAN
(CONT’D)
Zut alors!
IN
AUDIENCE


Milhouse and Samantha SCREAM. They grab onto each other,
then start KISSING. Bart sees this.


BART
(ANNOYED GRUNT)
EXT. THEATER -
DAY


Bart, Milhouse, and Samantha stand in front of the theater
as the crowd exits.


BART
I’ve got an idea. Let’s go spit in the
bug zapper.

MILHOUSE
Listen, Bart... there’s such a thing as


spending too much time together.


32.


8F22 FINAL DELIVERY 10/18/91 33.


BART
Getting sick of her, eh? Don’t worry,
Samantha. You’re only ten. You’ve
still got your looks.

SAMANTHA
Actually, Bart he meant we were sick of
you.

BART
(BEAT) Oh. Fine. I’m tired of
watching you two lip wrestle. There’s
plenty of other ways to be grossed out
in this town.


Bart walks around a corner and starts to SNIFFLE a little.
Milhouse pops his head around.


MILHOUSE
Bart, wait!
BART
(HOPEFUL) Yeah?
MILHOUSE
Uh... can we still use your tree house?
BART
What? Get bent.
MILHOUSE
If her father catches us -- he’1l kill
her.


A sneaky expression comes over Bart’s face.


8F22 FINAL DELIVERY 10/18/91 34.


BART
All right, Milhouse. You can use my
tree house. (SLY)
MILHOUSE
Thanks, Bart.
He exits.
BART
(TENTING HANDS) Samantha and Milhouse
sitting in a tree, about to lose their
pri-va-cy! (SININSTER LAUGH)
INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - KITCHEN - LATER
Bart has a sly look on his face as Homer enters.
HOMER
Now there’s a Machiavellian
countenance.


Bart gives him a look as Homer opens the fridge and pulls
out a six-pack.


HOMER
Ooh...a sextet of ale.
Homer takes a beer and exits. Bart goes to the phone.
BART
Hello, Mr. Stanky...I have some
shocking news about your daughter
Samantha...Who am I? Let’s just say
I’m a concerned prude with a lot of
time on his hands.
INT. TREE HOUSE - A LITTLE LATER


Milhouse and Samantha are KISSING.


8F22 FINAL DELIVERY 10/18/91 35.


SAMANTHA
I bet you had peanut butter for
breakfast.

MILHOUSE
(CHUCKLES) Yeah...


Suddenly Samantha‘s Dad, MR. STANKY, appears at the tree
house door.


MR.
STANKY
Samantha!

SAMANTHA
Dad!

MR.
STANKY


(ANGUISHED) Noooocoo0c000!


Mr. Stanky grabs Samantha, puts her over his shoulder and
brings her down from the tree house.


MR. STANKY
(CONT’D)
Samantha, you’re my little girl and
sometimes my imagination runs away with
me. Just, just tell me what happened.

SAMANTHA
Well, Milhouse and I --

MR.
STANKY
That’s enough! I’m putting you in
Catholic school. You’re never going to
see that boy again.


Samantha looks longingly at Milhouse standing in the
doorway of the tree house.


SAMANTHA


Milhouse!


8F22 FINAL DELIVERY 10/18/91 36.


SAMANTHA
Well, Milhouse and I --

MR.
STANKY
That’s enough! I’m putting you in
Catholic school. You’re never going
to see that boy again.


Samantha looks longingly at Milhouse standing in the
doorway of the tree house.


SAMANTHA
Milhouse!
MILHOUSE
Samantha!
Mr. Stanky puts Samantha in the car, SLAMS the door and
drives off. Milhouse starts SOBBING as Bart comes over and
looks uncomfortable.
BART
Well Milhouse, "Better to have loved
and lost"... yada yada yada... let’s
go to the arcade.
MILHOUSE
How could this happen? We started
out like Romeo & Juliet, but it ended
up in tragedy.
BART
(WORRIED) You’re gonna get over it,


aren’t ya Milhouse?


8F22 FINAL DELIVERY 10/18/91 37.


MILHOUSE
Bart, it feels like somebody gave my
heart a wet willie.

FADE
IN:
INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - MORNING


Homer and Marge are asleep. Through Homer’s earphones we
hear:


DR. MARVIN MONROE
(V.O.)
Zeitgeist: The prevailing mood of a
generation.
Lisa runs in.
LISA
Dad! Dad! Do you know what today
is?
HOMER
The vernal equinox?
LISA
No. It’s two weeks since you got
that subliminal weight loss tape.
Let’s get you on the scale.
HOMER
(MOANS) Oh, if only a svelte
morphology weren't so integral to the
‘90s zeitgeist.
INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER
Homer is on the scale. Lisa looks at the scale.
LISA
(PUZZLED) You’ve gained thirteen


pounds.


8F22 FINAL DELIVERY 10/18/91 39.


HOMER
Disingenuous mountebanks with their
subliminal chicanery! A pox on then!
INT. SCHOOLYARD -
DAY
Milhouse is dressed in black and is standing on the top
monkey bars like Heathcliff in "Wuthering Heights." The
wind blows his hair back.
CHUCK
There stands a broken man.
RALPH
It’s recess everywhere but in his
heart.
INT.
LISA’S BEDROOM = DAY
Lisa is reading "Eternity" magazine. Bart walks in.
LISA
Hey Bart, according to this magazine,
in another million years, man will


have an extra finger.


She shows a picture in the magazine of a normal hand with
four fingers and a thumb.


BART
Ew, freak show. (BEAT) Listen, Lis.
I need some advice and mom’s not
here.

LISA


Why didn’t you go to dad?


8F22 FINAL DELIVERY 10/18/91 40.


BART
I did, but I couldn’t understand what
the hell he was saying. Lisa, I’m
the one who ratted on my best friend
and he doesn’t even know I did it.

LISA
Oh, Bart you cheerful demolisher of
dreams.

BART
Yeah, yeah, that’s me all over. Now,
what do I do about it?

LISA
(FLIPPING PAGES) Well, according to
"Eternity" magazine, the feeling of
guilt has been linked to the
neutrotransmitter gammaphenamine.
Dow chemical is developing a minty
gel, which will eliminate excess
guilt, but unfortunately it won’t be
on the market for another six months.
So I guess you’re gonna have to bite
the bullet and confess to Milhouse.

Bart MOANS.
INT. SIMPSON LIVING ROOM - DAY


Homer is writing a letter. The stationery reads: "From the
Head of Homer."


HOMER


(WRITING LETTER) Sirs:


8F22 FINAL DELIVERY 10/18/91 41.


HOMER
(CONT’D)
I don my scrivener’s cap to castigate
you. For your inefficacious weight
reduction schema I demand expeditious
recompense.
Dyspeptic at your meretriciousness,
I am, Homer J. Simpson.
He throws the tape into the trash.
EXT.
MILHOUSE’S HOUSE - DAY - CONTINUOUS
Bart is on the porch. MILHOUSE’S MOM is at the door.
MRS. VAN
HOUTEN
Bart, I’m glad you’re here. Milhouse
won’t get out of bed and he refuses
to eat. Right now, he really needs a
friend like you.
BART
(WEAK LAUGH) Yeah.
INT.
MILHOUSE’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
A sad Milhouse lies in bed. Untouched plates of food are
here and there. Milhouse has a blanket tucked below his
head. He is staring up at the ceiling SOBBING.
BART
Milhouse?
MILHOUSE
Bart, I didn’t want you to see me


cry.


8F22 FINAL DELIVERY 10/18/91


BART
Come on, I’ve seen you cry a million
times. You cry when you scrape your
knee. You cry when they’re out of
chocolate milk. You cry when you’re
doing long division and you have a
remainder left over.
MILHOUSE
Well, I didn’t want you to see me cry
this time.
BART
(VERY SAD) Milhouse, it’s all my
fault. I’m the one who narked on
your kissing.
MILHOUSE
What?!
Milhouse GROWLS and leaps on Bart. Milhouse and Bart have
an all out fight, tumbling over one another, crashing into
Milhouse’s desk, smashing model airplanes, etc. Milhouse
is on top of Bart, CHOKING him, and slamming his head into
the carpet. The door opens to reveal Milhouse’s mom who
looks freakishly like Milhouse and MILHOUSE’S DAD, who’s
bald on top, but otherwise looks freakishly like Milhouse.
They watch the fight.
MRS. VAN
HOUTEN
(PROUDLY) Milhouse is out of bed and
full of beans.


MR. VAN
HOUTEN


(NERDY) Whoa, it’s a miracle!


42.


8F22 FINAL DELIVERY 10/18/91 43.


They shut the door. Out of desperation, Bart reaches out
to grab something lying nearby on the floor. His hand
passes by a pair of sharp scissors, a broken bottle, a
brick, until finally he grabs the Magic 8-Ball and SMASHES
Milhouse in the side of the head with it. Milhouse
staggers off. Milhouse and Bart both BREATHE HEAVILY.
Bart holds the shattered 8-ball.
BART
I bet the 8-ball didn’t see that one
coming.
MILHOUSE
Bart, why did you squeal on us?
BART
Because she took my best friend away
from me.
MILHOUSE
Wow, you must really like me to have
done something that awful to me.
BART
Milhouse, for you I’d send your dad
to the chair. Put ‘’er there, spit
brother.
They exchange SPIT-handshakes.
INT.
SIMPSON’S KITCHEN - DAY


Homer has a carton of ice cream in his hand and is pawing
through a drawer.


HOMER
Marge, where’s that...metal
dealie...you use to... dig... food.
MARGE


You mean a spoon?


8F22 FINAL DELIVERY 10/18/91


HOMER
(NODS HEAD VIGOROUSLY) Yuh. Yuh.
Yuh.
Marge hands him a spoon. He starts to EAT voraciously.
EXT. CATHOLIC SCHOOL -
DAY
Bart and Milhouse get off their bikes and stare at the
imposing wrought-iron gate which includes a sign that reads
"St. Sebastian’s School for Wicked Girls."
BART
Are you sure you want to do this?
MILHOUSE
I can’t stop thinking about her.
Even these gates remind me of her


braces.


They walk through the gate and see LITTLE GIRLS, in
Catholic School uniforms, playing.


BART
How are we going to find her?
MILHOUSE
She said she’d be wearing a plaid
jumper.
SAMANTHA
(V.O.)
Milhouse!
Samantha runs up to Milhouse. They grab hands.
MILHOUSE
Samantha, I wanted to say that this
wasn’t gonna break us up. But after
that two-hour bike ride, I think we’d


better say goodbye.


44,


8F22 FINAL DELIVERY 10/18/91 45.


SAMANTHA
I understand.
BART
Hey Samantha, I’m sorry about getting
you thrown in the penguin house.
SAMANTHA
(SOUNDING BORN AGAIN) That’s all
right, Bart. I love Saint
Sebastian’s. It’s run by a group of
French Canadian nuns. They’re very
nice except they never let me ooot.


Angelic looking NUNS play among the girls. One strums an
ACOUSTIC GUITAR
and SINGS as happy GIRLS CLAP along.


NUN
(SINGING) Dominique - nique - nique,
etc.
Another nun waves her finger at Samantha.
NUN
#2
Samantha, ne pas de boys!
SAMANTHA
I have to go now, Milhouse.
He goes to kiss her. She turns away.
SAMANTHA
(CONT’D)
I’d better not. It’s fifty rosaries
a kiss.
MILHOUSE
(DISAPPOINTED) Oh, okay.


8F22 FINAL DELIVERY 10/18/91 46.


Milhouse extends his hand. Samantha is about to shake it
when she pulls her hand back.


SAMANTHA
Oh, what the heck.


Samantha KISSES Milhouse and runs off and joins the other
girls. Milhouse turns to Bart.


MILHOUSE
Think I can ever find another one
like her?
BART
You’re asking the wrong guy,
Milhouse. They all look alike to me.
(THEN) Now let’s get to a TV.
Krusty’s coming on.
Bart and Milhouse walk off.
ART
CARD


We see Homer wearing a motarboard. A word balloon from his
mouth reads: “Homer sez: Increase your wordiness!"


Next to this are definitions of all the big words he used

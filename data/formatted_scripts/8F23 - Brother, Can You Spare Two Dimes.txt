ACT
_ONE


EXT. HOBO
JUNGLE


A bunch of BUMS are gathered around a large rusty cookpot.
Many of them look like bums we’ve seen in movies or on TV,
including Red Skelton’s "Freddie the Freeloader," William
Powell’s character in "My Man Godfrey," and Charlie
Chaplin’s beloved "Little Tramp." HERB POWELL, Homer’s
half-brother, sits with them. He also is dressed like a


bum.


BUM
Yeah... I used to be rich. I owned
"Mickey Mouse Massage Parlors". Then


those Disney bastards shut me down. I
said, "Look, I’1l change the logo, put
Mickey’s pants back on". Some guys you
just can’t reason with.

WILLIAM POWELL
LOOKALIKE
Yeah, I wrote many of your favorite
songs. (DARKLY) But I got shafted by
the record company.

HERB


What songs did you write?


8F23 FINAL DELIVERY 11/05/91


WILLIAM POWELL
LOOKALIKE
All your favorites. "My Hat’s Too Big
For Me," "The Dentist Song," "Lord How
I Hate A Small Town, " "Let’s Hear It
For October Ninth..."

HERB
I don’t remember that one.

WILLIAM POWELL
LOOKALIKE
(SINGING) "Oh, the Third Day of May
Is just another day, (SPOKEN)
Something, something, something
April twenty-fourth,
(SINGING) But the best day of all,
Is right around the start of fall,
Let’s hear it for October Ninth..."

HERB
Well, I used to own a successful car
company. (CONSPIRATORIALLY) My
strategy was giving them Japanese
names. You guys ever drive a Tempura
Hatchback?


The other bums MURMUR and AD LIB "I got hit by one of
those," etc.


HERB
Yeah, life was sweet. (BITTER) Then I
found out I had a long lost half-


brother.

EXT.
HERB’S ESTATE
We see the moment in "Brother Where Art Thou?" when Herb’s


car window comes down and Herb and HOMER see each other for
the first time.


HERB
Homer!
HOMER
Herb?
They embrace.
HERB
(V.O.)


I let him design a car that would make
or break my company.
INT. POWELL MOTORS

We see the unveiling of Homer’s car.

Herb falls to his knees and puts his hands over his face.
HERB
I’m ruined!
DISSOLVE
TO:
A Forbes magazine cover of Herb and "The Homer."
HERB
(V.0.)
Forbes Magazine called it the "Blunder
of the Century." A little overblown,
don’t you think? What about new Coke?
What about the Hindenberg? What about


Vietnam?

HOBO
JUNGLE


WILLIAM POWELL
LOOKALIKE
What a poignant story.

HERB
Yeah, but all that’s in the past.
Because this is America and in America
you’re never finished as long as you’ve
got a brain in your head. Because all
aman really needs is an idea.

BUM
Yeah, what’s your idea?

HERB
Pre-mixed peanut butter and jelly.

WILLIAM POWELL
LOOKALIKE
I think they’ve already got that.

BUM


And even if they don’t -- eh.


Herb slumps, dejected.


INT.


POWER PLANT - MAIN WORK AREA


A very long line of workers are lined up in their underwear
including Homer, LENNY, CARL and CHARLIE. There is a sign
on the room that says "Annual Plant Physical - NO
JOKES."They are holding a handful of official looking


forms.


Lenny is completely nude, though we cannot see


whether he’s anatomically correct or not.


HOMER


Forgot there was a physical today, huh?

8F23 FINAL DELIVERY 11/05/91 5.


LENNY
Yeah. (BEAT) Hey, Homer, can I borrow
your underwear?
HOMER
(THINKS) Nah.
INT. MEDICAL TESTING
AREA
DOCTORS
are watching and making notes on clipboards as
employees are put through a battery of tests. We see
employees on treadmills, stair-climbs, getting angiograms,
x-rays and those magnetic resonance things, etc.


INT. TESTING
AREA


We see a DOCTOR holding up a clipboard that says "SIMPSON".
The doctor reads the monitor.


DOCTOR
(SHOCKED) This can’t be right. This
man has 104% body fat!


He looks over in a immersion tank, and sees Homer eating a
chicken leg.


DOCTOR
(CONT’D)
Hey, no eating in the tank!
HOMER
Go to hell.
ON
LENNY
As he exits a cubicle and walks over to Carl smirking.
LENNY
I got even with those pushy doctors. I
took a whiz in this beaker.
INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - KITCHEN ~ THAT NIGHT


Homer comes in. MARGE is getting dinner ready.


8F23 FINAL DELIVERY 11/05/91 6.


MARGE
How was your day at work, dear?
HOMER
Oh, the usual. Stand in front of this,
open that, pull down this, bend over,
spread apart that, turn your head that
way, cough...
INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
We start CLOSE ON a wall. Suddenly the CAT flies by.
PULL BACK
to see LISA has thrown it on the couch. BART
talks into a spoon, as if it were a microphone.
BART
It’s been an exciting day here at the
Living Room Olympics. Lisa Simpson has
just set a new world’s record in the
cat put. Many suspect she’s a man.
LISA
Bart!
BART
Moving on to our next event, the always
controversial "couch vault".
Representing the Soviet Union, Bartov
the Great.


Bart picks up a broom stick and prepares to pole vault over
the arms of the couch onto the cushions.


BART
(CONT’D)
I do this for Mother Russia.


Bart vaults onto the couch -- it COLLAPSES into a heap.
The arms fall off. Bart jumps off the couch.

HOMER
(0.S.)


What the hell are you two... (SHRIEKS)


Homer enters the room and sees the broken couch.


Bart hugs


HOMER
(SOBS) Oh, my couch! The arms, the
seat... the dream is over. All right,
who did this?

BART
(INNOCENT) We were just sitting on the
couch, quietly chatting, when we heard
a creaking noise.

LISA
(DRAMATIC) We leapt off just in time to
see it collapse.
Lisa.

BART
There, there. You’re safe now, little


sister.


Homer sadly looks at the couch.


HOMER
Well, why did this have to happen now,
during primetime, when TV’s brightest
stars come out to shine!?

HOMER
(CONT’D)
(TURNS TO COUCH) Oh, goodbye, old
girl. We’ve had a lot of great

SMITHERS
looking through a microscope as BURNS approaches.

SMITHERS
Sir, I’m afraid Homer Simpson is
sterile.
BURNS
Who?
SMITHERS
One of your cabbage heads from Sector
7-G. Take a look at this sperm sample
from his recent physical.
BURNS’ POV THROUGH MICROSCOPE
It’s blurry at first, then begins to focus. We see three
sperm, all looking somewhat like Homer, banging heads and
falling to the bottom of the slide. One of the sperms has


three eyes.


BURNS


SMITHERS
(V.0.)
Now, compare this with a normal sperm
sample.
A new slide replaces the old one. It has numerous sperms
which have glasses and look like Smithers. They swim ina
very orderly fashion.
SMITHERS
(V.O.)
I’m afraid radiation from the plant is
the reason he is shooting blanks. He
could sue us for millions.

BURNS
Millions!? Mother of pearl. Call my


lawyers!

INT. PLANT -
HOMER’S WORK STATION - NEXT MORNING

Homer comes in, KNOCKS OVER something radioactive, steps in
a bucket of something radioactive, falls against an
instrument panel that lets out a bunch of SPARKS and dims
the lights in the plant, then sits down in his chair. He
puts his glowing feet up on the console and begins eating a
contaminated sandwich.

INT.
BURNS’ OFFICE


Burns is pacing and glaring at his assembled LEGAL STAFF.
(THE ONES FROM "BART GETS HIT BY A CAR.")


BURNS
Before you begin, let me make one thing
clear to you. I want your legal
advice. I even pay for it. But to me
you're all vipers. You live on
personal injury. You live on divorces.
You live on pain and misery... (GETS
HOLD OF
HIMSELF)...but I’m rambling.
Anybody want any coffee?

LAWYER
I’1l have some coffee.

Burns pours some coffee.

BURNS
Want it black, don’t you? Black like
your heart! It’s so hard for me to
listen to you, I hate you all so
much... I’m sorry. It’s my problem.


I’1l deal with it. Please continue.


8F23 FINAL DELIVERY 11/05/91 12.


LAWYER
If you offer Mr. Simpson a token sum --
say, a couple thou -- he’1l be so
dazzled, he’1ll sign anything you shove
under his nose.
BURNS.
(SNEERING) Oh, brilliant. A cash
settlement. I could have figured that
out, you button-down maggot.
LAWYER
Do you have any cream?
BURNS
Oh yes, of course. Where are my
manners?
INT. PARK -
DAY
Herb sits on a bench, trying to think of an idea.
[NOTE: RECORD THIS SPEECH AND THE ONE WHICH FOLLOWS. ]
HERB
Let’s see, I need an idea... Just find


a need and fill it. How about a


structure of some kind... to protect me
from the elements... like a, a
house!... Oh, wait, they have those
already... I got it -- something you


could wear over your clothes to keep
you warm. Oh wait, that’s a coat.


Damn this vicious cycle of poverty.


8F23 FINAL DELIVERY 11/05/91


From the next bench we hear a BABY CRYING. Herb looks
over, interested.


MOTHER
What do you want? I just changed your
diaper. Are you hungry? Are you cold?
Do you want to go home?
HERB
Lady, you just gave me the idea of a
lifetime. How do I thank you?
MOTHER
(SCARED) Please don’t hurt me.
HERB
Consider it done.
INT. PLANT -
HOMER’S WORK STATION


Homer is gloomily flipping random switches on his control
panel on and off. Lenny and Carl walk out.


LENNY
Hey pal, I heard about the couch.
CARL
(PATS ON SHOULDER) Yeah, you gonna to
be okay?
HOMER
(TOUCHING CARL’S HAND) Yeah. You
know, my life just can’t get any worse.
There is a long pause, as if someone has missed their cue.


Homer, Carl, and Lenny look at each other, then up at the
camera.


i?


8F23 FINAL DELIVERY 11/05/91 14


HOMER
(CONT/D)
That’s right. There’s no way my life
could possibly get any worse.


There is another long beat. Finally, Smithers’ voice comes
over the P.A.


SMITHERS

(OVER P.A.) Simpson! Report to Mr.
Burns’ office at once!

BURNS’ OFFICE
The lawyers are present. Homer enters.
BURNS
(ASIDE TO SMITHERS) Is this the one
with the cooked cojones?
Smithers nods.
SMITHERS
Hmmm hmmm.
BURNS
Ah, Simpson, you big virile son-of-a-
gun. How would you like a check for
two-thousand dollars?
HOMER
Would I! (SUSPICIOUS) Wait a minute.
Homer Simpson didn’t just ride into
town on a load of melons. What do I


have to do for this two thousand bucks?


8F23 FINAL DELIVERY 11/05/91


BURNS
Doh, there’s no catch. All you have to
do is sign this forn.
HOMER
No catch, eh. What do you take me for,
Burns? I’m not signing anything until
I read it, or somebody gives me the
gist of it.
BURNS
(DISGUSTED NOISE) All right, well, it
just explains that you’ve won -- yeah,
that’s it -- won the first annual...
Montgomery Burns... uh... Award for...
a-a-a Outstanding Achievement in...a-a
th... th.. the field of... uh,
Excellence!
HOMER
Wow. The most prestigious award of
them all.
Homer starts to sign the forms, but stops.
HOMER
Don’t I get some kind of trophy? At a
big award ceremony?
Burns looks at his lawyers. They nod.

Several bums stand around a trashcan with a fire in it.
One bum is sleeping with the Springfield Shopper that has

HERB
I’m telling you, all a man needs is an
idea. And I’ve got an idea.
BUM

Then how come you‘re still a bum?
HERB
All right. I’ve amended my premise. A
man needs two things, an idea and money
to get it off the ground. (BEAT)
Hello, what’s this?


Herb sees the paper, does a double-take, then snatches the
paper away and begins reading it.

Nah, you go ahead.

Homer, I know it’s tough now. But one

BARNEY
Hey, Foreman, shut up!
GEORGE
FOREMAN
Barney, you’ve been riding me all
night.
BARNEY
Oh yeah? Care to step outside?
He makes a fist.
GEORGE
FOREMAN
Let’s do it.


They step outside. We hear a short violent FIGHT. Barney

Since Zaire I’ve never made excuses. I
don’t wanna take anything away from the

while I was taking off my coat, he hit
me with a trash can.

Homer walks down the street.

HOMER
I feel so empty, so alone, so
couchless.


Homer walks past a closed furniture store. He looks in the

This chair is $2,000. We could buy a


whole living room set for that.

HOMER
Marge, there’s an empty spot I’ve
always had inside me. I tried to fill
it with family, religion, community
service. But those were dead ends. I
think this chair is the answer.

MARGE
This money was a blessing. We can’t
just spend it on some creature comfort.
We should do something to improve our
lives.

BART
Hey, you gotta spend that do-re-mi.
‘cause it can only go so fa.

Okay, fine. Now excuse me while I kiss

Herb is standing on the sidewalk in front of the Flanders’
house. He looks at the slip of paper in his hand that has
Homer’s address on it. The street number is a little
smudged. He looks at the number on the Flanders’ house.
After a moment’s uncertainty he walks up and KNOCKS on the
door.

I think it’s Mom’s turn, son.
TODD
Ah, no fair.
EXT.
FLANDERS’S HOUSE - A LITTLE LATER


Herb comes out the front door. He’s wearing one of
Flanders’ suits.


HERB
Thanks for the suit.
FLANDERS
You sure you can’t spend the night?
Maude and I can sleep on card tables.
HERB
Let me tell you something, as a guy
whose worn out shoes have walked every
dirt road in this country. You people
are freaks. And I mean that nicely.
TODD
(SINGS) "Onward Christian soldiers..."
The rest of the family joins in.
FLANDERS

INT. SIMPSON
HOUSE


Homer is sitting in an uncomfortable chair, next to the
broken couch. He overhears SINGING next door.


HOMER
They’re singing again. Lousy


neighbors. Wish I were deaf.


8F23 FINAL DELIVERY 11/05/91 27.


The doorbell RINGS. Homer goes to the door.
EXT. SIMPSON
HOUSE
Herb stands on the front porch.
HERB
(TO SELF) What am I gonna say? This
is the guy who ruined me. But on the
other hand, he’s family. So many
conflicting emotions. How to express
them...
Homer opens the door.
HOMER
Herb!
Herb punches Homer in the face. Homer GRUNTS.
INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM


Herb enters as Homer holds his jaw. The kids see Herb and
rush up to hug hin.


BART
& LISA
(JOYOUSLY) Unky Herb!
HERB
Bart... Lisa. I’m so glad to see you.
HOMER
(RUBBING JAW) You weren’t so glad to
see me.
HERB
I’m sorry, Homer. But I’m still mad at
you. Every word you say just makes me


want to punch you in the face.


8F23 FINAL DELIVERY 11/05/91


HOMER
Well, while you’re a guest in my home,
can you restrain that impulse?
HERB
I’1l try, but I’m not making any
promises.
Marge enters.
MARGE
(GASPS) Herb! How have you been?
HERB
I’ve been living in a cardboard box,
sleeping on grates, eating out of
dumpsters. You?
MARGE
Can’t complain.
HOMER
Herb, let me give you the grand tour.
This is one of our many light switches.
It functions in both the on and off
mode.
Homer flicks the switch on and off.
HOMER
(CONT’D)
On... off... on... off.
MARGE
Homer, he knows how to work a light


switch.


28.


8F23 FINAL DELIVERY 11/05/91


HOMER
Oh, yeah. Right. (MOVES TO SECOND
SWITCH) I don’t know what this switch
does.
Homer flicks the switch on and off.

We see colored lights that says "MERRY CHRISTMAS, AND A
HAPPY

The family is giving Herb a tour of the house.
INT. SIMPSON HOUSE

Herb and the Simpsons are eating dinner.
HERB
This is really great, Marge.
MARGE
Why thank you, Herb.
HERB
I haven’t had food this good
since...well, actually your next door
neighbor makes an excellent shrimp
scampi...
MARGE
(A LITTLE TIGHTLY) Maude Flanders is a
very good cook.
Herb notices Lisa eating silently.
HERB


Lisa, aren’t you happy to see me?


29.


8F23 FINAL DELIVERY 11/05/91


LISA
Why didn’t you write, Unky Herb?
HERB
Hey if I wrote to you what was I
supposed to say? "Dear Lisa,
last night I ate a pigeon, thanks to
your Pop?"
LISA
I see your point.
BART
Unky Herb, what advice would you give
to a boy who will most likely become a
bum like yourself?
HERB
Discarded pizza boxes are an
inexpensive source of cheese.
EXT. SIMPSON HOUSE - NIGHT - ESTABLISHING

powerful car!"


Herb tucks her in.

I’m gonna let you in on a little
secret, Maggie. You’re gonna make me
rich again. (BABY TALK) Yes-oo are!
Yes-oo are!
INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY


The Simpsons and Herb are on the floor playing Monopoly.
Herb ROLLS the dice, moves his piece.


HERB
1,2,3...Ventnor Avenue.

LISA
And while on Ventnor Avenue you’1l be
staying at the fabulous Hotel Lisa. A
valet will be around shortly to park
your thimble. Of course, there is the
unpleasant matter of the bill.

HERB
Get to the point.

LISA
(MERCILESS) Eleven hundred and fifty
bones.

Herb hands her all his money.

HERB
That’s all I got.

HOMER
(AMUSED) Broke again, eh Herb? Just
like in real life. Heh heh. I guess


you’re just not much of a businessman.


8F23 FINAL DELIVERY 11/05/91


HERB
(SMACKING FIST) You’re cruisin’...
you’re cruisin’...

MARGE
Maybe we should play another game.
We've got Sorry, Aggravation...

BART
Hey, we got two grand in the bank! Why
are we playing board games when we
could be making the club scene?

HOMER
(LYING) Wait Marge, didn’t you want to
spend that money on a vibrating chair?

MARGE
That was your idea!

LISA
While we’re on the subject, I think we
should invest in a set of the great
books of Western Civilization. Look at
this ad from "New Republic for Kids."
Each month a new classic will be
delivered to our door: "Paradise
Regained," "Martin Chuzzlewit," or
Herman Melville’s twin classics "Omoo"


and "Typee".


32:


8F23 FINAL DELIVERY 11/05/91


BART
I think we should get a machine gun.
We could use it to hunt game, spell out
things, or ring in the new year!
MARGE
Well, I really think we need to replace
the washer and dryer.
INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS


We see a washer and dryer VIBRATING all over the room. The
cat looks terrified he’1l be caught in their path.


BACK TO
SCENE

HERB
How would you like to spend 2,000
dollars to give a broken man a second
chance?

HOMER
Nah.

MARGE
Homer, wait. Herb, what’re you talking
about?

HERB
Up-up-up-up. Not here. Come on into
the dining room. I/11 want to give you
a twenty-minute presentation that will
change the world.

HOMER


(WHINY) Twenty minutes?!


33.


8F23 FINAL DELIVERY 11/05/91 34


HERB
Okay, okay. 1I/’11 make it ten.
EXT. SIMPSON HOUSE - DINING ROOM


The family is seated around the dining room table looking
expectant.


HERB
Okay. Now, before I tell you about my
idea, I’d like to show you this.


Herb puts a drinking bird toy on the table. Homer is
immediately delighted and amazed.


HOMER
(POINTING) It’s drinking the water!
HERB
Take it easy, Homer. Now this is an
example of how one little idea --
carefully marketed...
HOMER
That’s the greatest invention in the
world! You’ll make a million dollars!
HERB
(PATIENTLY) No, Homer. That invention
is out already. I’m just using it as
an example.
HOMER
(CHUCKLES) It’s going back for more!
Herb picks up the bird and puts it down next to the chair.
HOMER


(DISAPPOINTED SOUND)


8F23 FINAL DELIVERY 11/05/91


HERB
Homer, this is my invention.
Herb holds up a set of blueprints.
HERB
(CONT’D)
Now, of course, with these blueprints
you’1ll have to use your imagination.
HOMER‘’S IMAGINATION


The lines on the blueprints move around awkwardly, bang
into each other, then finally form the drinking bird.


BACK TO
SCENE
HERB
It’s a baby translator. It measures the
pitch, the frequency, and the urgency
of a baby’s cries. Then it tells
whoever’s around -- in plain English --
exactly what the baby is trying to say.
Everything from "Change me" to "Turn
off that damn Raffi record."
MARGE
(IMPRESSED) That’s a very clever idea!
HERB
All I need is a couple thousand dollars
to build a prototype. You’1l have your
money back in thirty days. I swear.
HOMER
Herb, listen to me. I’ve got three
kids, and the best part about a baby is


you can’t understand what it’s saying.


35.


8F23 FINAL DELIVERY 11/05/91 36.


HERB
Homer, I’ve said my piece. I/11 just
leave the room and let all of you
decide.

Herb exits.

BART
Dad, you give me my machine gun and I
can have your money back in a couple of
hours. Don’t ask how.

LISA
Bart, we owe a debt to Unky Herb. He
took us into his home and Dad destroyed
hin.

HOMER
You know, I’m pretty sick of hearing
about that. So I ruin one lousy
Fortune 500 company. Big deal. What
about the other 499 I didn’t ruin?

MARGE
I move we put it to a vote.

LISA
Second. All in favor of loaning Unky
Herb the two-thousand dollars say
"Aye".

MARGE/LISA


Aye!


8F23 FINAL DELIVERY 11/05/91 37.


HOMER
Nay! (TO BART) Well, boy, it’s all up
to you.
Bart looks at Marge.
MARGE
Bart, I don’t care how you vote as long
as you vote nicely.
HOMER
I’1l love you either way, but I want
you to vote nay.
BART
I vote aye.
Homer GROWLS and starts STRANGLING Bart.

A) INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - MAGGIE’S ROOM - DAY
OPEN ON
an oscilloscope labelled, "Oscilloscopes 4 Less".
We see a wave pattern and hear a BABY FUSSING. PULL BACK
to see Maggie is WHINING with Herb looking on and holding a
clipboard.
HERB
Now, let’s see... What could you be
trying to say? (CHECKING MAGGIE’S
DIAPER) Nothing downstairs... You just
took a nap...
Maggie starts SUCKING his nose.
HERB
(CONT’D)
(HOLDING NOSE) "I want to suck your
nose."
He writes on his clipboard.
B) CLOSE UP - HERB = A LITTLE LATER
Herb is wearing a monkey mask.
HERB
Ooga booga! Ooga booga!
Maggie makes a BABY NOISE.
HERB

(WRITING ON CLIPBOARD) "I’m scared."
C) INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT


Herb and Maggie are on the floor. Bart watches them from
the couch. Maggie makes a NOISE.


3B.


8F23 FINAL DELIVERY 11/05/91 39.


HERB
Hmm... the amplitude of the sine wave
is insufficient for "Burp Me", and this
saw-tooth formation is something I’ve
never...

Maggie BARFS in Herb’s face.

HERB
(CONT’D)
Eureka.

BART
Unky Herb, you’re killing yourself.

HERB
Well, the Springfield Baby Expo is
coming up and...

BART
You just don’t get it, do you. Hard
work is for the other guy. Everyday
Uncle Sugar is handing out billions of
dollars to any deadbeat with a sob
story. (WINKS) There ain’t no lid on
that cookie jar.

HERB
Bart, where did you pick that up?

BART
Sesame Street. (OFF HERB’S LOOK) Well,


you gotta read between the lines.


8F23 FINAL DELIVERY 11/05/91


INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY


The family is gathered around to see Herb’s prototype,


which is under a cloth. Herb stands in his suit. Maggie


is dressed up in a cute baby outfit.
HERB
Now, I bet you’re all wondering what
lies under this sheet.
BART
Not really. We peeked inside while you
were in the john.
HERB
Oh. Well, here it is again. My "Baby


Translator!"


Herb unveils a clumsy-looking device composed of wires and
lights with a speaker on one side. The Simpsons stare at


it for a beat.
MARGE
(TOO BIG) Whoooa!!
HERB
Marge, you don’t have to humor me.
MARGE
Well, it’s pretty ingrained.
HERB
What do you think, Homer?
HOMER
Herb, this is the stupidest thing I’ve
ever seen. I can’t believe we blew two
thousand bucks on it, when right now


rollers could be kneading my buttocks.


40.


8F23 FINAL DELIVERY 11/05/91 41.


HERB
Homer, could you stop thinking about
your ass!
HOMER
I try, but I can’t.
Maggie makes a NOISE.
HERB’S VOICE
(THROUGH BABY TRANSLATOR) Lavish
attention on me and entertain me.
MARGE
(GASPS) Maggie, you talked!
HERB
You see! It tells you exactly what’s
on the baby’s mind. Takes the guess
work out of parenting.
LISA
(COVERING FACE) Maggie! Maggie!
Maggie makes a NOISE.
HERB‘S VOICE
(THROUGH BABY TRANSLATOR) Where did
you go?
Lisa uncovers her face.
LISA
Peek-a-boo!


Maggie LAUGHS.


8F23 FINAL DELIVERY 11/05/91


HERB’S VOICE
(THROUGH BABY TRANSLATOR) Oh, there
you are. Very amusing.
HERB
Well, Homer, now what do you think?
HOMER
I dunno, Herb. People are afraid of
new things. You should have taken an
existing product and put a clock in it
or something.
MARGE
Homer, every mother in the country is
going to want one of these.
Maggie makes a NOISE.
HERB’S VOICE
(THROUGH BABY TRANSLATOR) I have
soiled myself. How embarrassing.
EXT. SPRINGFIELD CIVIC CENTER - DAY

Convention. NO TRIPLETS!"

displaying new kinds of baby toys and baby related items.

unsteadily at new products and falling over as the platform
revolves.


The CAMERA PANS past several booths, including a booth that
has a large sign that says "Dog-In-A-Ball". In front of the
booth is a large plastic ball with a real full size dog in
it. A BABY is pushing at the ball. The dog inside is
baffled. A banner says "Babies Love To Play With Dog-In-A-
Ball".

8F23 FINAL DELIVERY 11/05/91 43.


The CAMERA PAUSES when it gets to PROFESSOR FRINK. He is
flying a BABY around in a model airplane.


PROFESSOR
FRINK
This radio controlled, gas-powered
plane gives junior the opportunity to
see if he’s got "The Right Stuff." He
can execute the barrel roll... loop-de-
loop... then bring it in for the
perfect landing.


The Baby Plane executes these stunts, then flies out a
window.

Whoop, oh dear. My brother is going to

He throws the magazine away.
INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - A FEW DAYS LATER

HERB
Homer, here’s a check for two-thousand
dollars. But I also wanted to give you
each a little something for believing
in me. (HANDS LISA BOOK) Lisa, this
is the first volume of The Great Books
of Weste: Civi tion. You’1l
receive a new one every month. From
"Beowulf" to "Less Than Zero."

Finally, a copy of "Pilgrim’s Progress"
to call my own.

HERB
(CONT’D)
Now Bart, I know you’re too young for
the machine gun you wanted. But I’m
going to give you something that’1l
make sure when you’re old enough you
can still buy one. A membership in the
National Rifle Association.

BART
Wow! The NRA. You know, they visited
my school five times this year. Will I
be able to get teflon-coated armored
piercing bullets, too?

HERB
It’s in the Constitution, son.


He turns to Maggie.

Marge...

MARGE
Herb, I appreciate your generosity, but
I don’t need any gift from you.

HERB
You’re too late, Marge. I got youa
new washer and dryer. They’re already
downstairs and I sold the old ones for
fifty bucks.


Herb hands Marge the money.

Homer walks Herb to his car.
HOMER
What do I get? What do I get? It’s
not another punch in the face is it?
Because if it is, I don’t want it.
HERB
This is what you get, Homer. I forgive
you. You can call me brother and I can
do the same.
HOMER


That’s it?


8F23 FINAL DELIVERY 11/05/91 48.


HERB
That’s it.
HOMER
(SINCERELY) I see your point, brother.
HERB
Gimme a hug, brother.

All right...but I never really hugged a

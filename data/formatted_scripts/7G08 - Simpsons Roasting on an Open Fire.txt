EXT. STREET - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT

It's snowing. The Simpsons' car zips down an icy street.
The brakes are put on a little too hard and the car SKIDS
off the road into a snowbank.

EXT. CAR -
NIGHT
They get out of the car. Maggie is incredibly bundled up in
a snow suit. Her arms stand out straight sideways -- like
a starfish. They head for the auditoriun.
MARGE
Careful, Homer.
HOMER
It's no time to be careful.
We're late.
EXT. SPRINGFIELD ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT
It's snowing. We pull in on the school's illuminated
activity board. It reads "Annual Christmas Pageant. 3 1/2
Stars! -- Springfield Shopper."

INT. AUDITORIUM -
NIGHT


On the stage, the CHOIR is singing "OH LITTLE TOWN OF
BETHLEHEM."


Homer, Marge and Maggie enter the auditorium. They walk
down the aisle looking for seats. They enter a row,
jostling people as they go.
MARGE
(HUSHED VOICE) Excuse us. Pardon
me... excuse me...
HOMER
(SIMULTANEOUSLY)
Hey, Norman. How's it going? So you
got dragged down here too...heh, heh,

The Simpsons find seats and sit down. The choir finishes
singing. The crowd APPLAUDS. PRINCIPAL SKINNER steps up to


the podiun.
SKINNER


(UNREHEARSED) Wasn't that wonderful?
And now,
"Santas of Many Lands," as presented by
the entire second grade class.

MARGE
Oh... Lisa's class.


The curtain opens and JANEY, dressed as Santa with red
lederhosen, walks on to the stage.


JANEY

(SHY & NERVOUS) Frohlich weihnachten --
that's German for Merry Christmas. In
Germany, Santa's servant Ruprecht gives
presents to good children and whipping
rods to the parents of bad ones.

She curtsies.

CLOSE-UP

TODD
Meri Kurimasu. I am Hotseiosha, a
Japanese priest who acts like Santa
Claus. I have eyes in the back of my
head so children better behave when I'm
nearby.
Todd turns around and we see that he has fake eyes in back
of his head. The audience GASPS. Todd exits the stage.
The entire auditorium is darkened. There is a drum roll.
MR. LARGO
(0.S.)
And now, presenting Lisa Simpson, as
Tawanga, the Santa Claus of the South
Seas.
A frantic jungle drum begins. LISA comes on stage wearing
a huge Polynesian headdress, a coconut bra and grass skirt.
She is holding fire torches and she does an incredibly
elaborate dance.
PRINCIPAL
SKINNER

The fourth grade will now favor us with
a melody, medley of holiday flavorites.
The stage curtain parts to reveal BART'S fourth grade
class, standing on bleachers. The children begin to sing
"Jingle Bells."
CHILDREN

MARGE
"Dear friends of the Simpson family, we
had some sadness and some gladness this
year. First the sadness. Our little
cat, Snowball, was unexpectedly run
over and went to kitty heaven. But we
bought a new little cat, Snowball II,
so I guess life goes on. Speaking of
life going on, Grampa is still with us,
feisty as ever. Maggie is walking by
herself. Lisa got straight "A"s, and
Bart, well... we love Bart. The magic
of the season has touched us all...

Christmas so much.


Homer goes to the drawer and opens it, pulling out a very
tangled extension cord.


HOMER
(GRUMBLING) ... every year, stupid
cord.
He starts unravelling it.
MARGE
All right, children. Let me have those
letters. I'll send them to Santa's
workshop at the North Pole.
BART
Oh, please. (TO LISA) There's only
one fat guy that brings us presents and
his name ain't Santa.
Marge looks at Lisa's list.
CLOSE-UP


on Lisa's list shows a Pony, followed by Pony, followed by
Pony, Pony, and Pony.


MARGE
A pony? Oh, Lisa. You've asked for
that for three years and I keep telling
you that Santa can't fit a pony into


his sleigh. Can't you take a hint?


FINAL DELIVERY
8/24/89 PAGE 8.


LISA
But I really want a pony and I've been
really, really good this year.

MARGE
(MURMURS) Oh dear. Maybe Bart is a
little more realistic.

She looks at Bart's list.

MARGE

rest of the your life.

Hello, Marge. It's Patty. Selma and I
couldn't be more excited about seeing
our baby sister for Christmas eve.
MARGE
Well, Homer and I are looking forward
to your visit, too.


In the b.g., Homer mimes sticking a finger down his throat
and makes gagging SOUNDS and exits.


PATTY
(V.0O.)
Somehow I doubt that Homer's excited.
Of all the men you could have married I
don't know why you picked the one whose

EXT. SIMPSON HOUSE

A grimly determined Homer balancing on the ladder as he
hangs strings of Christmas lights on the roof line. A
moth-eaten Santa dummy is leaning against the chimney.
Homer falls off the roof and lands in the snow with a THUD.
He connects two extension cords.
HOMER

Okay, kids. Prepare to be dazzled.

FLANDERS

(FROM NEXT DOOR) Just hold your
horses, son. Hey, Simpson.
HOMER
What is it, Flanders?
FLANDERS
Do you think this looks okay?
Everyone turns to look at the house next door where Homer's
neighbor, Flanders, plugs in his light display. In moving
lights resembling a Las Vegas marquee, it spells out M-E-R-
R-Y X-M-A-S.
Then flashes MERRY XMAS rhythmically. The


entire roof then lights up and we see a MECHANICAL SANTA
and elves.

HOMER
And what would you like, little boy?
TEACHER
You're not really Santa, tubby.
HOMER
Why you little eggheaded...!
TEACHER
No, no, Homer. If such an emergency
arises, just tell them Santa's very
busy this time of year and you're one
of his helpers.
HOMER

one, too.
INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - FOYER - NIGHT


Homer enters and removes his coat. Marge emerges from the
kitchen.

MARGE
But Homer. My sisters are here. Don't
you want to say hello?
HOMER
(SHUDDERS)
Marge leads Homer into the living room. Marge's TWIN
SISTERS, Patty and Selma (both with huge hair, but not as
huge as Marge's) sit on the couch with Bart and Lisa.
Patty has Bart on her lap and is pinching his cheeks as
Selma fusses with Lisa's hair. Both kids squirm to get
away.
BART
Oh, Dad, you're finally home.
LISA
Daddy! We're so glad to see you!
They jump off the couch and run to hug Homer.
HOMER
What? Why? Oh yeah. (FORCED
POLITENESS) Hello Patty, hello Selma.
How was your trip?
SELMA
Fine.
HOMER
You both look well.

Homer stops in his tracks.
HOMER
And why is that?
PATTY
Well, for one thing, there's no tree.
HOMER
Well, I was just on my way out to get
one.
LISA
Can we go too, Dad?
BART
Can we, can we?
HOMER
No!
Homer starts putting his coat back on and exits.
EXT. STREET -
NIGHT
Homer drives along. It is snowing lightly. He passes a
Christmas tree lot with a sign surrounded by lights reading
"All trees $75". He continues driving, passing another lot
with a sign "Trees $60 and Up". He goes on past another
lot with a sign reading "Xmas Trees - Slightly Irregular -
$45 and Up". All the trees are bizarrely shaped.

HOMER
So, what do you think kids? Beauty,

BART
Yeah, Homer.

And then I want some Robotoids... and
then I want a Goop Monster... and then


I want a great big, giant...
HOMER
Ah, Son. You don't need all that junk.
I'm sure you've already got something
much more important, a decent home and
a loving father who would do anything
for you. (W.C. FIELDS-ISH) Gimme a
bite of that donut, I couldn't afford
lunch.
We see a flash and hear the CLICK of a camera and

little boy tries to recoil with his donut.

Ah, touche!


Bart gets in line. All the kids in line are half the size
of Bart.


HOMER
The Elf is taking a kid off Homer's lap.
LITTLE
GIRL
I hope you feel better, Santa.
HOMER
I will when Mrs. Claus's sisters get
out of town. Thanks for listening,
kid.


The Elf puts Bart on Homer's lap, lifting him with a GRUNT.
Homer GASPS with recognition.


BART
Hey Santa, what's shaking?
HOMER

Homer and Bart hunch down in the tiny workshop.
BART
Don't kill me, Dad. I didn't know it

Nobody knows. It's a secret. I didn't

I'd do anything.

HOMER
What?
BARNEY
You heard me. I'm going to the dog
track. I got a hot little puppy in the

HOMER
Sorry, Barney. I may be a total
washout as a father, but I'm not going

Ah, come on Dad, this can be the
miracle that saves the Simpsons'

anything, it's that miracles always
happen to poor kids at Christmas. It
happened to Tiny Tim, it happened to
Charlie Brown, it happened to the
Smurfs, and it's going to happen to us.

We see the dog track with a couple of winos outside.
Homer, still in his Santa suit without beard and hat, and
Bart, wearing the Santa hat, walk through the gate with
Barney.
BART/ BARNEY

takes to get along.
HOMER
(GRUMBLING) I can't believe I'm doing

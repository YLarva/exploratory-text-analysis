FADE
IN:
EXT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL -
DAY
MRS. KRABAPPEL
(pronounced KRUH-BOP-EL), BART and the rest
of her CLASS wait at the curb in front of the Springfield
Elementary School. A sign on the wall reads "SPRINGFIELD
ELEMENTARY
SCHOOL", with "EL BARTO" spray-painted nearby.
The class is a NOISY rambunctious group. Mrs. Krabappel
brings a police whistle tied around her neck to her mouth
and BLOWS it.
MRS.
KRABAPPEL
Now, class, I don't want this field
trip to be a repeat of our infamous
visit to the Springfield State Prison.
So I want you all to be on your best
behavior. Especially you, Bart
Simpson.
BART
Mrs. Krabappel. I didn't unlock that


door.

The SOUND of a BUS ENGINE and HEAVY METAL MUSIC grows
louder. A school bus drives over the curb and SCREECHES to
a halt in front of Mrs. Krabappel and class. The door
SQUEAKS
open and the bus driver is OTTO DUGAN, a pale,
aging heavy metal dude with dyed black hair and a headset
with headbanger MUSIC BLARING TINNILY from under his
driver's hat. He seems hung over.


Otto leans out the driver's window and looks at the kids
lined up below.


OTTO
(MOANS) Sorry, little dudes. Party
hardy equals tardy.
MRS.
KRABAPPEL
All right, (CLAPS HANDS) children,
count off.
The line of kids slowly moves around the bus. We HEAR the
kids COUNTING OFF in the background. When Bart is below
the driver's window, he looks up.
BART
(CONT'D)
Hey, Otto. Hey, Ottoman.
OTTO
Hey, Bartdude.
BART
Any new tattoos, Otto?
OTTO
Oh, funny you should ask, man. This
morning I woke up with this one.


Otto rolls up the sleeve of his T-shirt to reveal a flaming
skull with a dagger dripping blood stuck through it.


BART


Cool! I want one.


Final Delivery - 6/15/89 - Page 3.


oTto
Huh, not till you're fourteen, my
little friend.
Otto puts on a Walkman and starts to rock to Metallica.
MRS. KRABAPPEL
(0.S.)
Bart! Bart Simpson!


We CUT WIDE, Bart realizes the rest of the line has gotten
on the bus. Bart zips off.


INT.
BUS
Bart enters. As he looks into the filled bus, he sees that
there is one seat left in the second-to-the-last row, next
to a fragile-looking boy, WENDELL. The CAMERA ZOOMS in on
the boy as the MUSIC STINGS dramatically.
MRS.
KRABAPPEL
Take your seat, Bart.
BART'S
P.0O.V.
BART
Oh, please, Mrs. Krabappel, not next to
Wendell. He pukes on every bus ride.
(TO WENDELL) No offense, Wendell.
WENDELL
(MOANS)
MRS.
KRABAPPEL
Be that as it may, it's the only seat
left. So get in there.
As Bart crosses to the second to the last row, the other
kids AD LIB: "Chop on you," "Tough luck," "Nice knowin!


you, Simpson." They also make GAGGING NOISES and mime
throwing up. Bart sits down next to Wendell.


Final Delivery - 6/15/89 - Page 4.


WENDELL
Please try not to shake the seat like
that.


Mrs. Krabappel takes the mini-microphone and begins to
speak, but loud piercing FEEDBACK comes out of the speaker.


MRS.
KRABAPPEL
(INTO MICROPHONE) Now class, remember,
do not stick any part of your body out
the window. We all know the tragic
story of the young man who stuck his
arm out the window and had it ripped
off by a big truck coming in the other
direction.


The bus is hushed in awe. Bart stands up, one arm tucked
inside his shirt, his shirt sleeve flapping.


BART
And I was that boy!


There is a mixed reaction of SCREAMS and CHEERS from the
students.


MRS.
KRABAPPEL
(INTO MICROPHONE) Bart Simpson, sit
down. I've had just about enough of
your tomfoolery. Now I want ten
seconds of silence from all of you or
this bus isn't going anywhere. One,
two--

LEWIS
(0.S.)


Buckle my shoe.


Final Delivery - 6/15/89 - Page 5.


MRS.
KRABAPPEL
(INTO MICROPHONE) I mean it. We're
not leaving until I get five seconds of
silence. One, two, three...
BART
(SINGING) Strikes, you're out at the
old ball game.
The kids LAUGH.
MRS.
KRABAPPEL
(INTO MICROPHONE) All right, one
second of silence. One. (TO OTTO)
Go! Ha!
The bus STARTS UP with the horrible GRINDING OF GEARS.
WENDELL
(MOANING) I don't feel so hot.


Bart is not happy. The BUS PULLS OUT and starts down the
road.


EXT. ROAD -
DAY


The bus passes a BUBBLING PIT with a sign reading:
“SPRINGFIELD TOXIC WASTE DUMP." Kids wave and MEN in
safety suits wave back.


They pass the tire yard, where old tires are stacked as far
as the eye can see and a sign states "SPRINGFIELD TIRE
YARD. HOME OF LOTS OF OLD TIRES". Some kids in the bus
wave out the window and several YARD WORKERS, covered head
to toe with soot, wave back.


The bus drives by a large concrete building labeled
"SPRINGFIELD STATE PRISON. OVER 1200 SERVING". The kids
wave and we see arms sticking out of barred windows waving
back.

LEWIS


Look, there's our school again.


Final Delivery - 6/15/89 - Page


The bus indeed passes the school.
MRS.
KRABAPPEL
Otto, are you sure you, ah...?
oTToO
Shortcut, Mrs. K, trust me.
INT.
BUS


Wendell is getting very sick and woozy. Bart frantically
raises his hand.


BART
Mrs. Krabappel...! Mrs. Krabappel...!
MRS.
KRABAPPEL
(INTO MICROPHONE) Bart, not another
word out of you, or I'll subject you to
the humiliation of making you sing in
front of the class.
BART
Can I pick the song?
MRS.
KRABAPPEL
(INTO MICROPHONE) No. The song will
be, "John Henry Was A Steel Drivin!
Man".
BART
Oh no.
Bart makes the gesture of zipping his lips shut. Two
angelic twins in neat little dresses, TERRI AND SHERRI, are
seated in the last row, right behind Bart and Wendell.
SHERRI
We're going to make you sing, Bart


Simpson.


Final Delivery - 6/15/89 - Page 7.


They pull his ear. Bart keeps his mouth clamped shut.
TERRI
Yeah, Bart Simpson. We're going to
make you sing.
They pull his hair. Bart emits a small closed-mouth SQUEAK
of protest. Terri and Sherri confer in WHISPERS for a
beat, then they both kiss Bart, one on each cheek.
BART
(ANGUISHED WAIL OF DISGUST)
Mrs. Krabappel turns around.
MRS.
KRABAPPEL
(INTO MICROPHONE) That's it, Bart!
Oh! Why can't you be more like...
uh... uh... uh...
SHERRI/TERRI
(RAISING HANDS) Us, Mrs. Krabappel?
MRS.
KRABAPPEL
Yes... Sherri and Terri. They know how
to behave.


Sherri and Terri sit with their hands folded on their laps,
looking perfect, with an angelic light behind their heads.


EXT. NUCLEAR POWER PLANT - DAY


The bus pulls up in front of the Springfield Nuclear Power
Plant. A sign labels the plant and under it states:
"WE'RE SAFER THAN YOU THINK." Bart is SINGING "John
Henry", inserting his name into the lyrics.


Final Delivery - 6/15/89 - Page 8.


BART
(SINGS) "They took Bart Simpson to the
graveyard / And they buried him in the
sand, oh, yeah / And every locomotive
that comes roarin' by / Says, 'There
lies a steel-drivin' man,' Lord! Lord!
Oh, there lies a--"
MRS.
KRABAPPEL
(INTO MICROPHONE; INTERRUPTING) All
right, Bart, that's enough.
BART
Hey, Wendell, you made it, buddy.
Bart SLAPS Wendell on the back.
EXT.
BUS


We HEAR a RETCHING NOISE. The kids exit the bus as quickly
as possible, spilling out the emergency door and windows.


INT. NUCLEAR POWER PLANT - MAIN SECURITY BOOTH
The GUARD is eating a sandwich, and watching "Krusty the
Klown" on a small bank of security monitors. The children
pass by, ducking under the turnstile, unseen.
INT. CONFERENCE ROOM -
LATER
The class is seated in a meeting room. A permanently
smiling slick public relations man, MR. SMITHERS, is at the
front giving a lecture, using a pointer and a wall chart.
SMITHERS

...-And so this plant harnesses the

power of the atom so that we have the

energy to run everything from your


favorite video game to yummy cotton


candy machines.


Final Delivery - 6/15/89 - Page 9.


SMITHERS
(CONT'D)
Let's learn more about nuclear energy,
shall we? Lights.
The lights dim and a projector begins WHIRRING.
ON MOVIE
SCREEN


We see the "4,3,2,1" of the film leader and then the title
card:


"NUCLEAR ENERGY: OUR MISUNDERSTOOD FRIEND"
NARRATOR
(V.0)
(FROM SCREEN) When most people think
of nuclear energy, they think of this.
The screen shows a mushroom cloud.
ON
CLASS


Watching the film in excitement, the kids CHEER and APPLAUD
as their faces reflect the glow of the ON-SCREEN EXPLOSION.


ON MOVIE
SCREEN
NARRATOR
(V.O. CONT'D)
(FROM SCREEN) But when we talk about
nuclear energy, we really mean this.
The screen shows a family using every electrical appliance
possible: stereo, TV, electric fan, vacuum cleaner,
electric toothbrush, shaver, etc. A pig is also being
roasted on a rotisserie. The screen goes blank as
different colored question marks appear.
NARRATOR
(V.O. CONT'D)
(FROM SCREEN) But what exactly is
nuclear energy? I don't know, but I


know someone who does: Smilin' Joe


Fission.


Final Delivery - 6/15/89 - Page 10.


SMILIN' JOE
FISSION, a little animated character looking
like the symbol for the atom with arms, legs and a smiling
head attached, walks on screen.
SMILIN' JOE
FISSION
(FROM SCREEN) Hi there, energy eaters.
I'm Smilin' Joe Fission, your atomic
tour guide to the strange and exciting


world of nuclear power.


Smilin' Joe Fission walks over to THREE GLOWING, SWEATING
RODS
with faces and legs.


SMILIN' JOE FISSION
(CONT'D)
(FROM SCREEN) And these are rods of
uranium two-thirty-five. Hi, Rod.
Hey, Rod. How you doin', Rod?


The Rods AD LIB: "Hey, Smilin' Joe;" "Howdy;" "Good to
see ya;" etc.


SMILIN' JOE FISSION
(CONT'D)
(FROM SCREEN) Hey, you guys look hot.
ROD
#1
(FROM SCREEN) Of course we're hot.
ROD
#2
(FROM SCREEN) We're radioactive!
SMILIN' JOE
FISSION
(FROM SCREEN) Uh oh, well, how ‘bout a
dip in the pool?


The rods run to a pool and jump in acrobatically. The rods
AD
LIB: "Wheee!", "Last one in is a rotten rod!", etc.


SMILIN' JOE
FISSION
(FROM SCREEN) The rods make the water


so hot, it boils.


Final Delivery - 6/15/89 - Page 11.


The water starts to BOIL.
RODS
(AD LIB) Ooch! Ooch! Ouch. Ooh!
Hot! Oh, pain!
SMILIN' JOE FISSION
(CONT'D)
(FROM SCREEN) And the steam spins
turbines that generate energy.


Turbines spin and animated WHISTLES make carnival MUSIC.
A silhouette of Bart's head blocks the screen.


MRS.
KRABAPPEL
(WHISPERS) Down, Bart.
Bart sits down.
BART
(WHISPERS) How'd she know it was me?
BACK ON
SCREEN


Angry little glowing ROCKS with waving arms come marching
by Smilin' Joe Fission.


SMILIN' JOE
FISSION

(FROM SCREEN) Uh oh. Whoops! Looks

like there's a little leftover nuclear

waste! No problem! I'll just put it

where nobody'1ll find it for a million

years.
Smilin' Joe Fission sweeps the nuclear waste under a rug,
then stomps on the rug to smooth it out. A nuclear waste


rock POPS out and LAUGHS OBNOXIOUSLY. Smilin' Joe Fission
kicks it off screen.


Final Delivery - 6/15/89 - Page 12.


SMILIN' JOE
FISSION

(FROM SCREEN) So now you know the
whole true story of Nuclear Energy, Our
No Longer Misunderstood Friend. So
tell your friends and tell your folks.
And keep on smilin'.

Smilin' Joe Fission winks and waves.

TITLE
CARD: "THE END". MUSIC up and out.

ON
CLASS


Mr. Smithers turns the lights back on. The class APPLAUDS
WEAKLY.


MRS.
KRABAPPEL
Very informative.
SMITHERS
Thank you. And now, let's have even
more fun.
Mr. Smithers presses a button and a huge steel door OPENS
WITH A WHIR.
We HEAR an OMINOUS THROBBING HUM. We see a
sign that reads "EXTREME DANGER: RADIOACTIVE AREA. ENTER
AT YOUR OWN
RISK.!"!
INT. PLANT -
DAY


Mr. Smithers leads the class through the labyrinthine
plant.


SMITHERS
--And over here is our thermal
regulator. To your right, if you look
through this window, you'll see where
our water rejoins the rest of nature's


biosphere.

Through a window, a pipe spills out onto a beautiful glen.
A three-eyed fish jumps out of the water and back in. The
tour continues.


SHERRI
Hey, Bart. Our dad says your dad is
incompetent.

BART
What does "incompetent" mean?

TERRI
It means he spends more time yakking
and scarfing down donuts than doing his
job.

BART
Oh, okay. I thought you were putting
him down.

INT. COFFEE ROOM -
CONTINUOUS


Homer is sitting by the coffee maker, munching donuts.
Other WORKERS stand around in radiation suits.


HOMER
You know, I defy anyone to tell the
difference between these donuts and
ones baked today. Hey, my boy's
s'posed to be here any second now on a
field trip. They been through here


yet?

WORKMAN
#1
Come on, Simpson. If they wanted the
kids to see you sitting around on your
butt and stuffing your face they'd take
them on a tour of your house.
HOMER
(EXCITED) You're right! I gotta get
where the action is!
Homer runs and hops into his electric cart, setting his cup
of coffee on the dashboard. He steers with one hand, and
holds a donut up with the other hand. The cart takes off
very slowly. SFX: ELECTRICAL HUM. Homer BEEPS his little
horn in warning.
HOMER
(CONT'D)
Comin' through.
INT. PLANT - CATWALK - CONTINUOUS
Bart and the other kids are on a catwalk above the work
area. They're near a sign reading: "OUR SAFETY RECORD:
7 DAYS WITHOUT AN ACCIDENT." Bart looks down to see Homer
driving through in his electric cart.
BART
Hey, there's my dad. (YELLS) Hey,
Dad! Yo, Homer!
Homer looks around.
BART
(CONT'D)
Woo! Woo! I'm up here!
Homer looks up and waves his donut.


HOMER


oh, hi, boy!


Final Delivery - 6/15/89 - Page 15.


Homer, having taken his eyes off the road, CRASHES head-on
into a pipe with the nuclear symbol on it. The pipe breaks
open and 8TEAM shoots out onto the entire class. An ALARM
goes off, steel doors SLAM shut, the "7 DAYS" sign changes
automatically to "0 DAYS." The foreman walks out with a
bullhorn.
FOREMAN
(INTO BULLHORN) Please, there's no
need to panic! Everything's under
control!
Various WORKERS in radiation suits pull levers and turn
valves, shutting off the steam. Quickly, everything is
quiet. The Foreman looks around with his hands on his
hips.
FOREMAN
(CONT'D)
(INTO BULLHORN) All right, who's
responsible for this?


The other workers point at Homer. Homer reluctantly raises
his hand.


FOREMAN
(CONT'D)
(INTO BULLHORN) I might have known it
was you, Simpson.

HOMER
But sir, I--

FOREMAN
(INTO BULLHORN) I don't want to hear
about it, Simpson. You're fired.


(LOOKING UP) Oh, hi, girls!

FADE
IN:
INT. SIMPSON HOUSE -
DAY
It is the morning in the Simpson household. The entire
family is gathered around the breakfast table preparing for
the day. Bart and LISA are eating cereal. MAGGIE sits in
her highchair eating an unknown goo-like substance. Homer
sits at the table wearing a coat and tie with his hair
neatly combed. MARGE is cooking Homer's breakfast,
scraping some crispy fried eggs off a frying pan and
putting them on Homer's plate. Lisa is reading the
classified section of the morning paper.
LISA
Here's a good job at the fireworks
factory.
HOMER
(DEPRESSED) Those perfectionists?
Forget it.
LISA
How 'bout this: Supervising Technician


at the toxic waste dump.


Rev. Final Delivery - 10/16/89 - Page


HOMER
(SADLY) I'm no Supervising Technician.
I'm a Technical Supervisor. I've never
done anything worthwhile in my life.
I'm a big worthless nothing.
MARGE
There, there, Homer. You'll find a
job. You've caused plenty of
industrial accidents and you've always
bounced back.
LISA
Yeah, Dad. You can do it!
BART
Yeah, go for it, Dad.
HOMER
You're right! I'm young, I'm able-
bodied, and I'll take anything. Watch
out, Springfield, here I come.
CUT TO A SERIES OF SHOTS that include:
An ornate wooden door SLAMS shut in Homer's face.
A factory door SLAMS shut in Homer's face.
A frosted glass office door SLAMS shut in Homer's face.


A large rolling metal door of a garage SLAMS down in front
of him.


The drive-by window of a fast-food restaurant SLAMS shut in
Homer's face.


Finally a normal door SLAMS in his face. It reopens a
crack to reveal Bart sticking his head out.

Bart SLAMS the (Simpson's) front door in Homer's face.
INT. BAR - MOE'S TAVERN - AFTERNOON
Homer is sitting at the bar staring at his glass.
HOMER
I'm just a Technical Supervisor who
cared too much.
SFX: PHONE RINGS. Moe picks it up.
MOE
(INTO PHONE) Moe's Tavern.

you I'm gonna rip your arms and legs
ort!
INT. SIMPSON
HOUSE
Bart and Lisa roll on the floor, LAUGHING convulsively.
INT. MOE'S
TAVERN
Moe hangs up angrily.
HOMER
You'll get that punk someday, Moe.
MOE
I don't know. He's tough to catch. He
keeps changing his name.
HOMER
(REACHES INTO HIS POCKET) Moe, I think
I'll have another -- (OPENS WALLET,
SEES IT IS
EMPTY) -- Whoops. (CHECKS
POCKETS, PULLS INSIDE OUT) Moe, I'ma
little low on funds. You think could
cover me just this once?
MOE
Sorry.
HOMER
Why not? I think after all these years


I deserve an explanation.


Rev. Final Delivery - 10/16/89 - Page 21


MOE
Well, I don't think you're ever going
to get another job and be able to pay
me back.

HOMER
oh.

MOE
Now, don't worry, I mean, we're still
friends.


Homer MUMBLES as he goes to the door, takes one last
wistful look around, and exits.


INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT - DARK


Homer and Marge are in bed. We hear INCOHERENT MUMBLING
from Homer.


MARGE
Are you all right, Homer?
She turns on the lights. Homer is a bug-eyed
personification of anxiety. Marge puts her arms around
Homer. She is wearing a four-foot nightcap... the same
size as her hair.
HOMER
I'm fine. I'm just thinking.
MARGE
Well, I've been thinking too. You
know, Homer, you've always been such a
good provider, but when we got married,


Mr. Berger promised I could come back


to my old job anytime I wanted.


Rev. Final Delivery - 10/16/89 - Page 22


HOMER
You think you can still do that kind of
work?
MARGE
Sure! You never forget. It's just
like riding a bicycle.
CUT
TO:
EXT. BERGER'S BURGERS -
NIGHT
We are in a drive-in restaurant. Attractive WOMEN in tight
mini-skirts come out carrying trays of food, followed by

LISA
Dad, eat something. It's got mustard
on it.


HOMER'S P.O.V - THE

Rev. Final Delivery - 10/16/89 - Page 23


LISA
I don't know what else to do.


Maggie leans in and SUCKS. She taps Homer on the eye, her
finger filling the screen. SFX: PING, PING, PING.


BART
There's only one thing we can do. Take
advantage of the old guy. You gotta
sign my report card, Dad.
Bart shows Homer a report card (lots of F's and U's ).

He opens cake box. There is a cake inside that says "Don't
worry, Daddy, we love you anyway."


HOMER

Damn!
Homer tosses the cake over his shoulder. Homer's face
becomes twisted with insanity (a la Jack Nicholson in "The
Shining").
HOMER

I need money!
INT. BART'S BEDROOM -
NIGHT
Bart is sleeping peacefully in his bed. His room is
littered with discarded toys, comic books and cookies. The
door CREAKS open and Homer creeps into the room, still in


the grip of madness. After a moment of searching, his face
lights up.


Rev. Final Delivery - 10/16/89 - Page 25


The CAMERA ZO0OMS IN on a piggy bank that sits on a shelf
just above Bart's head. Homer eyes it and then quietly
crosses the room and grabs the piggy bank. He freezes when
he hears Bart SNORT in his sleep. Homer waits a beat and
then creeps out of the room.
INT. KITCHEN - SIMPSON
HOUSE
Homer places the piggy bank on the counter and picks up a
hammer. He hesitates, then brings the hammer down on the
piggy bank with a MIGHTY GRUNT. SFX: SMASH.
HOMER
Oh no, what have I done? I smashed
open my little boy's piggy bank, and
for what? A few measly cents. Not
even enough to buy one beer. (THEN)
Wait a minute, let me count and make
sure...
He rummages through the shards, counting rapidly.
HOMER
(CONT'D)
Not even close.
Homer walks over to the refrigerator. On the freezer door
is a memo pad with a pen on a string. The pad says "DUMB
THINGS I GOTTA DO
TODAY" with beautiful flowing flowers
along the borders. Homer takes the pen that hangs from a
string and writes:
HOMER
(CONT'D)
“Dear Family: I am an utter failure
and you'll be better off without me.
By the time you read this, I will be in
my watery grave. I can only leave you


with the words my father gave me:


"Stand tall, have courage and


Rev. Final Delivery - 10/16/89 - Page 26


never give up.' I only hope I can
provide a better model in death than I
did in life. Warmest regards, Homer J.
Simpson."


Homer lets go of the pen and walks out of the house.


Rev. Final Delivery - 10/16/89 - Page 27


EXT. SIMPSON BACKYARD -
NIGHT


Homer has a rope tied around his neck. He ties the other
end of the rope to a big rock which he lifts with a MIGHTY
GRUNT.
He takes one last look at the house and SIGHS.
Then he pushes open the front gate, which SQUEAKS. Homer
frowns, and lugs his rock to the tool shed. He re-emerges
with a can of 3-IN-1 Oil in one hand. He oils the squeaky
hinge. Then, still lugging the rock, he puts the oil back
in the tool shed and exits through the now non-squeaky
gate.


EXT. STREET -
NIGHT


We see a GRUNTING Homer walk off into the night carrying
the rock.

IN:
EXT. SIMPSON NEIGHBORHOOD -
NIGHT
Homer MOANS as he staggers down the street with his rock.
It is dark and the streets of Springfield are empty. After
a few steps, he passes the house where THE WINFIELDS, an
old couple, are passing the time out on the porch.
MRS.
WINFIELD
Oh, looks like young Simpson is going
to kill himself.
OLD MAN
WINFIELD
Maybe not. Maybe he's just taking his
boulder for a walk.
They CHUCKLE. Homer walks on.
INT. MASTER BEDROOM -
NIGHT
Bart and Lisa rush in and shake their mother.
BART
Mom! Mom! Wake up!


LISA


We've been robbed!


Rev. Final Delivery - 10/16/89 - Page


MARGE
What?
BART
Someone swiped my piggy bank.
Marge, Bart and Lisa rush out.
INT. LIVING
ROOM
Marge and Bart see Homer isn't on the couch.
MARGE
(GASPS) Your father's gone, too.
BART
(MUMBLING) They must have taken
everything shaped like a pig.


Lisa runs into the living room holding Homer's suicide
note.


LISA
Look what I found.
EXT. STREET -
NIGHT
Homer is now dragging the rock toward the bridge, which is
across the intersection. We HEAR the RUSH of the river
below.
HOMER
(PANTING) Almost there.


Homer is halfway across the street when a car comes out of
nowhere blaring the HORN and narrowly missing Homer.


HOMER
(CONT'D)
Hey, you idiot! Watch where you're
going.
EXT. SIMPSON
HOUSE


The rest of the family, in their pajamas, robes, and
slippers, rushes out of the house toward the bridge.

Rev. Final Delivery - 10/16/89 - Page


ENTRANCE TO THE
BRIDGE
Homer drags the rock to the middle of the bridge. He sees
there's an identical large rock there, right where he's
going to leap off. He looks at that rock, and then he
looks at his rock.
HOMER
Well, live and learn.
EXT. STREET -
NIGHT
The family sees Homer and they halt in horror
MARGE
There he is!
BART
Don't do it, Dad!
THE
FAMILY
They rush out into intersection to stop Homer.
Homer sees the truck coming towards his family.
HOMER
(GASPS) Watch out!
THE
FAMILY
The speeding truck rushes towards them.


HOMER


Unties the rope from around his neck, tosses it aside, and
rushes towards the family.


FAMILY
The truck swerves and misses them as Homer runs out into
the intersection. He hugs them and leads them off the
street.

HOMER


Boy, this intersection is dangerous!


Someone ought to put a stop sign here.


29


Rev. Final Delivery - 10/16/89 - Page


A ray of golden light lands on Homer's head. We HEAR a
CELESTIAL
CHORUS.


MARGE
Oh, Homer, how could you think of
killing yourself? We love you.
LISA
Yeah, Dad. We love you.
BART
Don't ever try that again, Dad.


As Homer speaks, the sun rises behind him. The whole
family is bathed in a golden glow. Birds start to SING.


HOMER
Kill myself? Killing myself is the
last thing I'd ever do. Now I have a
purpose, a reason to live. I don't
care who I have to face. I don't care
who I have to fight. I will not rest
until this street has a stop sign.


The family all hug and look off into the golden sunrise.
It's a new day for the Simpsons.


EXT. SPRINGFIELD CITY HALL - SUNSET


Establishing shot of the very unimpressive-looking City
Hall. The name "EL BARTO" is written in spray paint across
the face of the building.


INT. CITY COUNCIL CHAMBERS - EVENING


The Simpsons sit in the front row of an almost empty
session of the Springfield City Council. Homer and Bart
are in suits and ties. Marge and Lisa are in nice dresses
and Maggie wears a special bonnet. On the council dais are
THREE
MEN, two average-looking white men and one average-
looking black man. Councilman #1 BANGS his gavel.

COUNCILMAN

Ah, next on the agenda, Police Chief
Wiggum will give us an update on our
graffiti problem.


The uniformed CHIEF swaggers up to the podium still wearing
his sunglasses.


CHIEF
(CLEARS THROAT) It's no secret that
this city has been plagued by a
graffiti vandal known as "El Barto."
Police artists have a composite sketch
of the culprit. If anyone has any
information, please contact us
immediately.
He holds up a flyer with a drawing that looks similar to
Bart only older and meaner, with beard stubble and a
cigarette. He hands it to Bart, who looks at it and passes
it on.
BART


Cool, man!


Everyone AD LIBS: "Ooh, tough customer," "Don't want to run
into him in a dark alley", etc.


COUNCILMAN
#1
And now, new business. (READING)
Homer Simpson, local resident, has
something. Mr. Simpson?

MARGE
(WHISPERS) Don't be nervous. We


believe in you, Homer.


Rev. Final Delivery - 10/16/89 - Page


Homer takes out a thick stack of papers and nervously steps
up to the podium. He gathers his speech and notes and
takes a moment to compose himself.


HOMER
(CLEARS THROAT) Ladies and gentlemen,
esteemed Councilmen, boys and girls,
retired people with nothing better to
do. Danger comes in many, many forms,
from the dinosaurs that tormented our
cavemen ancestors to the --

All in favor?
COUNCILMEN
Aye.
COUNCILMAN

Approved. Meeting adjourned. Coffee

Homer, confused, slowly walks back to his family.


MARGE


You did it, Homer.

A look of pride and awe crosses Homer's face.
HOMER
Wow. They listened to me. I've really
done something for once.
LISA
All right, Dad!
BART
Way to go, Homer!
Maggie SUCKS in approval.
HOMER
Hey, if they think I'm going to stop at
that stop sign, they're sadly mistaken.
MONTAGE
Homer proudly poses with his family in front of the new
stop sign. There is a bright flash and the moment becomes
a still photo on the page of a newspaper, (The Springfield
Shopper). Every new location in this sequence follows that
pattern.
Homer poses on his knees next to a speed bump. CAMERA PANS
UP TO
"SPEED BUMP" sign. The headline reads "DOZENS CHEER
HOMER
SIMPSON."


Homer points to a "SIGN AHEAD" sign. The headline reads
"HOMER SIMPSON STRIKES AGAIN."


He clamps his hand over his head in victory next to a
"PLEASE DRIVE FRIENDLY" sign. The headline reads "WATCH
OUT HERE COMES
HOMER."

We're IN COLOR now. The park is covered with signs like
"CHILDREN AT PLAY", "NO SKATEBOARDING", “GIVE A HOOT, DON'T
POLLUTE", etc. Marge ENTERS FRAME carrying a camera.
Homer is still wearing his cap.
MARGE
Oh, Homer. I'm so proud of you.
HOMER
(DOWN) Proud. Proud of what?
MARGE
Well, everything. (GESTURING) Your
dip sign, for instance. Now people
won't be caught off-guard by that
little (MAKES DIP GESTURE WITH HER
HAND) in the road.
BART
Yeah, they used to call that place Dead
Man's Dip.
HOMER
Ah, what a great family! But come on,
we all know this is small potatoes.
There is a danger in this town that is
bigger than all the dips put together.
LISA
What, Dad?
HOMER
I'm talking about that!


Homer points dramatically to the West, toward the Nuclear
Power Plant.

Nothing.

That's okay. I'll just assume you said

The crowd APPLAUDS. Homer climbs up on the car, causing
the roof to buckle slightly and the suspension to creak.


HOMER
(INTO BULLHORN) Thank you.
The crowd settles.
HOMER
(CONT'D)
(INTO BULLHORN) Unlike most of you, I
am not a nut. Just a good, honest
American who opposes wrongdoing and
especially carelessness wherever they
occur.
HIGH ANGLE
HOMER


We watch Homer rouse the crowd with his oratory. WE PULL
ouT and we're in:


INT. MONTGOMERY BURNS'
OFFICE


Montgomery Burns, the sinister but charismatic president of
the power plant and Smithers are watching Homer.


BURNS
(SIGHS) Look at that man. He has the
crowd in the palm of his hand. Haven't
seen anything like it since Jolson.


Who is he?


REV. FINAL DELIVERY
10/16/89 PAGE 37.


SMITHERS
(HANDS BURNS BINOCULARS) That's Homer
Simpson, sir. He used to work here in
the plant, but we fired him for gross
incompetence.

BURNS
Oh, so that's his little game. Get
this Simpson character up here right
now.

SMITHERS.
But, Mr. Burns.

BURNS
I said, DO IT! NOW DO IT! DO IT! Do
Iv!

EXT. POWER

Homer is still standing on the car addressing the audience
with a bullhorn.


HOMER
(INTO BULLHORN) Our lives are in the
hands of men no smarter than you or I.
Many of them, incompetent boobs. I
know this because I have worked along
side them, gone bowling with them,
watched them pass me over for
promotions time and again. And I say,
this stinks!


The crowd CHEERS. Smithers and TWO BIG GOONS approach
Homer. We see rest of the Simpsons in the crowd.


REV. FINAL DELIVERY
10/16/89 PAGE 38.


BART

SMITHERS
Hey, Simpson.
A hush falls over the crowd.
SMITHERS

Burns wants to talk to you, privately.
HOMER
(INTO BULLHORN) Privately?
SMITHERS
(PUSHING AWAY BULLHORN) Yes.
HOMER
(INTO BULLHORN; TO CROWD) Stay here,
I'll be right back.
Crowd CHEERS.
Homer carefully tries to climb down off the car and falls
to the ground. Quickly getting to his feet, Homer and
Smithers enter the plant grounds.
INT. MONTGOMERY
BURNS! OFFICE


Burns sitting behind his gigantic desk with just one file
folder on it. Homer meekly walks in.

Simpson. I want you to rejoin our

HOMER
Sorry, no can do!

BURNS
Hear me out, Simpson. I don't want you
to come back as a Technical Supervisor,
or Supervising Technician, or whatever
the hell you used to do. I want you to
be in charge of safety here at the
plant.

HOMER
Safety? But sir, if the truth be
known, I actually caused more accidents
around here than any other employee.
There were even a few doozies no one
ever found out about.

BURNS
The generous offer I'm making is good
for exactly thirty seconds, Simpson.

He turns over a thirty second egg timer on his desk.

What should I...
BART
Simpson! Time's up!
HOMER
Umm... What the hey. I'll take the
job.
BURNS
Excellent! Your first duty will be to
step out on the (GESTURING) balcony and
tell that crowd this plant is safe.
HOMER
(GASP) What?
BURNS,
Go on, Homer. You've got a family to
feed. Get out there.
Homer steps out to WILD CHEERS and CHANTS of "Homer,
Homer." He motions to the crowd to quiet down and holds up
the bullhorn.

(INTO BULLHORN) Oh, sit tight. I'11
be right back.
Crowd CHEERS. Homer crosses back into the office.
BURNS
Now what.
HOMER
I can't do it, Mr. Burns. I looked
into the faces of my family out there
and I realized I couldn't lie to them.
BURNS
You mean you're willing to give up a
good job and a raise just for your


principles?


REV. FINAL DELIVERY
10/16/89 PAGE 42.


HOMER
Hmmm. When you put it that way, it
does sound a little farfetched. But
that's the lug you're looking at. And
I vow to continue spending every free
minute I have crusading for safety. of
course, I'd have a lot less of those
free minutes if you gave me the job.
BURNS
You're not as stupid as you look... or
sound... or our best testing indicates.
You've got the job. Now get to work.
HOMER
I'll get to work. But first I have to
say goodbye to some friends.

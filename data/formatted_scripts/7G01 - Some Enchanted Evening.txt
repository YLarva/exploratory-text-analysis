An idyllic scene. The sun is rising, birds are CHIRPING.
We PULL IN on the house.


DISSOLVE
TO:
INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - KITCHEN - EARLY MORNING
MARGE
looks out the window as she makes breakfast. She's
wearing a bathrobe. MAGGIE is in a high chair, SUCKING on
her pacifier.
MARGE
(SATISFIED SIGH, IN A TRANQUIL, HUSHED
TONE) You know, Maggie, this is my
favorite time of the day. Just you and
me, making a hearty breakfast for the
rest of the family, stoking their
little furnaces for the busy day ahead.
MAGGIE
(SUCKS)


Marge cracks some eggs into a pan. SFX: SIZZLE.

MARGE
And you know what else I like about the
wee hours of the morn? This is our
time to be together.
In quick succession, the toast POPS, the oatmeal BLURBLES,
tsa kettle WHISTLES, and the eggs are ready. Marge
finishes setting a beautiful tableau of a breakfast table,
and pours herself a cup of coffee.
MAGGIE
(SUCKS IN AGREEMENT)
MARGE
Oh, I dread the day when you realize
you're a separate human being. (KISSES
MAGGIE ON
FOREHEAD) 0h, listen,
Maggie, I think I hear those
sleepyheads now...
INT. HALLWAY - FAMILY'S
P.0.V
We see Marge and the breakfast table at the end of the long
hallway. The CAMERA RAPIDLY TRACKS down the hallway,
shaking as if it's in the midst of a cattle stampede. Some
of the picture frames on the wall swing back and forth.
SFX: RUMBLING STAMPEDE. Marge smiles until the very end of
their approach, and then her smile fades.
INT.
KITCHEN
(NOTE: The following chaos occurs in extremely fast
action.) HOMER, BART, and LISA stampede in. Homer is
wearing a shirt and tie, but no pants. He immediately


switches on the radio. SFX: ANNOYING TRAFFIC REPORT, which
continues throughout the following scene.

KBBL WEATHERMAN
(V.0O.)
(OVER RADIO) ...with a possihility of
showers later tonight. And now to our
own pie in the sky, Bill Pie, in the
KBBL
traffic copter.
SFX: LOTS OF CHOPPER NOISE.
BILL PIE
(V.0.)
(OVER RADIO) Bad news, drivers.
There's an overturned melon truck on
the Interstate. Oh, is it a mess.
There's a lot of rubber necking going
on, so expect delays of up to three
hours. Meanwhile, over on south-bound
Main Street, traffic is stop and go,
backed up from the Springfield Arts and
Crafts Festival on Beach Street. And
there's a multiple fender bender
outside of the Springfield Civic
Center, so I'd stay clear if I was you.
This is Bill Pie, your pie in the sky,
saying good-bye.
Bart looks at the breakfast with a disgusted expression.
BART
Ugh.
He runs to get a box of presweetened cereal, with a picture


of Krusty the Klown on the box, opening and SLAMMING shut
lots of cabinet doors and the refrigerator.


Final Draft - 5/8/89 - Page 4.


BART
(CONT'D)
Hey! Where's the Frosty Krusty Flakes? *
(FINDS THEM) Aha!
Lisa also opens and SLAMS cabinet doors looking for donuts.
Homer, shaving with a cordless shaver, stands by the table,
grabbing fried eggs with his hands and dropping them down
his gullet. MAGGIE'S pupils bounce around as they follow
the frenetic goings-on.
MAGGIE


(SUCKS NERVOUSLY)


+


Bart sits down at the table with his flakes. He removes a
spoonful of sugar from the sugar bowl, and pours the *
contents of the bowl on his cereal. Marge looks unhappy.
MARGE
(DISMAYED) But there's hearty
oatmeal... and fresh squeezed O.J...
and whole wheat toast...
Bart and Lisa see what the other is having for breakfast.
BART
(WITH MOUTH FULL OF SUGARY CEREAL)
Hey! Donuts!
Bart stretches across the table and grabs the donut box.
LISA
Bart, there's one left and it's mine!


Lisa and Bart have a tug of war with the donut box. They
RIP
the box in half, sending the donut flying.


MAGGIE
(SUCKS NERVOUSLY)


Homer smoothly grabs the donut with one hand and drops it
in his mouth. Bart and Lisa react with disgust.


Final Draft - 5/8/89 - Page 5.


LISA
Awww, Dad.
BaRL
(SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH ABOVE) Awww...
Homer!
Homer daintily SUCKS on the tips of each finger while Marge
glares at him. Homer takes Marge's cup of coffee from her
saucer, which she's been holding throughout the scene, and
SLURPS
from it noisily. Then he puts the cup back on the
saucer.
HOMER
Ahhhh! (CHECKS KiS WATCH, THEN LOOKS
DOWN) Whoops, don't want to go to work
in my shorts! (CHUCKLES AT OWN WIT)
Homer exits. SFX: BUS HORN BEEPING
LISA
(MOUTH FULL) Uh oh, school bus.
SFX: ANOTHER BUS HORN BEEP
Bart goes to the window.
BART
Hey, cool your jets, man. We're
comin'!
Bart GULPS one last long swig of milk straight from the
half-gallon carton and wipes his mouth with the kitchen
curtain. Bart and Lisa grab their coats and school books
and race out of the kitchen. Marge holds up their lunch
boxes. (Bart's: Krusty the Klown, Lisa's: Happy Little
Elves.)
MARGE
(CALLING) You forgot your lunches.

Bart has his hand jammed into Marge's purse. He pulls out
a few bills and deals some to Lisa.


BART
That's okay, Mom!
LISA
We got money!
Bart and Lisa race out the door and SLAM it behind then.
(NOTE: As they race out, the Simpsons' black cat,
SNOWBALL
II, enters.) Marge enters and crosses to the
front door.
MARGE
Now just a darn... (DISAPPOINTED SIGH)
After a beat, Homer comes bounding down the stairs fully
clothed, ZIPPING up his pants. Homer doesn't notice Marge
puckering up for a good-bye kiss. So, as he crosses
through, her puckered lips rotate. When he exits, SLAMMING
the door behind him, the door hits Marge square in the
puckered lips, causing her hair to wobble.
INT.
HALLWAY
Marge crosses into kitchen, annoyed.
INT.

Marge enters.
MARGE
Well, Maggie, it's just me and you

Maggie has fallen asleep in her high chair.

Gee, a romantic evening. She bugged me

SIMPSON HOUSE -
FOYER


MARGE
What a mess. How come all the lights
are on?

HOMER


I don't like the looks of this. *e


Homer and Marge look around nervously.


MARGE


Ms. Botz? Ms. Botz?


SIMPSON HOUSE -
DEN


Botz is on the rlioor, hog-tied and gagged, but


conscious.


Her suitcases are nearby. "The Happy Little


Elves" tape is playing on the TV.


HOMER
& MARGE (0.S.)


Ms. Botz? Ms. Botz?


Homer and Marge enter the den.


HOMER
(SHOCKED) Good Lord! What have those


little hellions done now?


Final Draft - 5/8/89 - Page 49.


Homer RIPS the tape off Ms. Botz's mouth, and begins to
untie her.


HOMER
We're so sorry, we're so sorry.
MS.
BOTZ
Please turn off the Tv.
Marge shuts off the TV.
EXT. SIMPSON
HOUSE


Homer and Marge lead Ms. Botz to her car. Homer is
struggling with her suitcases.


MARGE
I can't tell you how chagrined we are
about all of this.

HOMER
These things are heavy.


They load her car. Ms. Botz gets behind the wheel. Homer
takes out his wallet.


HOMER
Just so there's no hard feelings,
here's double your pay. No, no,
triple.

MS.
BOTZ
Thank you.

HOMER
Just don't call the cops.

MS.
BOTZ
Don't worry, I won't. Mr. Sampson, can


I give you a bit of advice?


Final Draft - 5/8/89 - Page 50.


HOMER
Sure.
MS.
BOTZ
Don't turn your back on that boy for a
second.
HOMER
Ain't that the truth. You know, one
time he --
Ms. Botz SCREECHES off in her car.
We HEAR SIRENS approaching. A wave of police cars, and the
"America's Most Armed and Dangerous" mobile van pull up,
SCREECHING.


The kids, POLICEMEN, "America's Most Armed and Dangerous"
TV REPORTER
and CAMERA CREW jump out.


BART
This way to the scene of the crime,
men. We've got her tied up in the den.


Bart goes darting into the house. Homer grabs him by the
collar.


HOMER
Just a minute, young man. I don't know
what kind of shenanigans you've been
pulling this time, but I just had to k
untie your babysitter and pay her off
so that --


A microphone is thrust in Homer's face, and a spotlight is
put on him.


Final Draft - 5/8/89 - Page 51.


TV
REPORTER
Excuse me, sir, are you saying to the
world that you just aided and abetted


the escape of the notorious Babysitter


Bandit?
HOMER

Babysitter Bandit? Uh...Uh...Are you *
sure this microphone works? (TAPS THE *
MIKE). Uh, well, I wouldn't say I *
aided her. (TAPS AGAIN) This is on, *
right? Because, actually, it was quite a
a struggle. I mean, she overpowered *
me, but that's just because she got the *
jump on me, and she's so muscular and- *
and heavily armed.


Bart SLAPS his forehead and shakes his head in
disappointment.


BART
Awww, Homer.
CLOSEUP - TV
SCREEN


Homer is on TV. The subtitle reads: "Homer Simpson, Local
Boob."


Final Draft - 5/8/89 - Page 52.


HOMER
(ON TV) Have you ever secn a Kung Fu
movie? (GESTURES) It was just like
that. But now, I know her moves. (TO
CAMERA) So, if you're listoning to me,
lady, you better think long and hard
before trying something like this on
the Simpsons again.


We HEAR A CLICK as Homer shuts off the TV with the remote
control.


INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT


Homer and Marge are in bed. Homer puts down the remote
control.


HOMER
I'm such a jerk.

MARGE
Oh, Homer, don't say that. The way I
see it, if you raise three children who
can knock out and hog-tie a perfect
stranger, you must be doing something
right.

HOMER
Yeah.

They kiss. Homer turns out the light.


FADE
OUT:

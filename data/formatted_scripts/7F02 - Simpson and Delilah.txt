IN:
INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - EVENING
The Simpsons are gathered around the TV, watching a game
show as they finish their corned beef hash and mashed
potatoes. PATTY and SELMA are on the couch with HOMER.
Maggie is in her high chair, pointing the TV remote control
into her eye and clicking the buttons. BART and LISA have
left their dinners half-eaten; Bart is mashing his food
into a big pile.
MARGE
enters, carrying a tray of tall dessert cups filled
with multi-colored layers of pudding with whipped cream on
top. She hands cups to Bart and Lisa, who grab at then
hungrily and slide their dinner plates into the corner of
the room, where SANTA'S LITTLE HELPER licks the plates
clean. Patty and Selma look at their plates and stop
eating.
TV HOST
(V.0O.)
The capital of North Dakota is named
after what German ruler?


Homer SPUTTERS and waves his hand dismissingly, as in "How
could they ask such an easy question?"


HOMER
Hitler.

MARGE
Hitler, North Dakota?

PATTY/SELMA
Bismarck.

BART

Thanks for playing, Homer. We
have some lovely parting gifts
for you.

HOMER
Hey, I'm still beating you, boy.

BART
Wow, you're beating me. Real
tough.

The colors of the Italian flag are

TV HOST
(V.0.)
«+. and we'll get to it right after
this important message.


A commercial comes on the TV. It shows a GOOD-LOOKING MAN
with thinning hair walking along a beach.


GOOD-LOOKING MAN
(V.0.)
I used to think losing my hair was as
inevitable as the tides. Then I found
out about dimoxinil, the new miracle
breakthrough in hair regrowth.

HOMER
(GASPS) Miracle breakthrough! Did you
hear that, Marge?

GOOD-LOOKING MAN
(V.O.)
The odds are dimoxinil can help me grow
as much, or as little, hair as I want
to. Hey, today I'm gonna do it.

ANNOUNCER
(V.0O.)
For your free brochure, send five
dollars to: Dimoxinil, 458 Hair Plaza,
Hair City, Utah.

Homer is entranced.

HOMER

(WISTFULLY) Hair... hair... Just like


everybody else.

PATTY
(TO SELMA) Listen to him ramble.
SELMA
(TO PATTY) No fool like an old fool.
INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - BATHROOM - EVENING


Homer cleans out his medicine cabinet, tossing out bottles
marked "NuGro" (which is in the shape of the medical symbol


for masculinity), "U Wanna B Hair-E", "BaldBuster", "Ulan
Bator Formula", "Gorilla Man Scalp Blaster", "Hair Chow",
and "HairMaster". Marge is watching at the door.

HOMER


I'll march right into the Quick-E-Mart

and say, "Give me the biggest styling

brush you got!"

MARGE
You know, some women find bald men
quite virile.
HOMER

Pfft. Virile. Who wants to be virile?

Marge, weren't you listening? This is

a miracle breakthrough. Not one of

these cheapo sucker deals.
He holds up a bottle to illustrate his point.
INT. SPRINGFIELD MALL - NEXT DAY
Moving very nonchalantly, Homer walks up to an office
marked “SPRINGFIELD HAIR CLINIC. Dr. Harry Boyle,
specialist in: Hair loss, varicose veins, skin peels,
collagen injections, warts and fungus, tattoo removal,
rashes, hives, yeast infections and liver spots." Below the
sign is a four-stage picture display of a man who starts
out with acne, moles, no hair and a big frown and winds up
with a clear complexion, lots of hair and the biggest smile


you ever saw. Homer enters the shop. DR. BOYLE stands
behind the counter.


TABLE DRAFT
3/21/90 PAGE 5


HOMER
I'd like some dimoxinil, the new
miracle breakthrough in hair regrowth,
please.
The doctor takes out a big bottle of dimoxinil.
DR.
BOYLE
That will be one thousand dollars, sir.
HOMER
(CHOKES) A thousand bucks?
DR.
BOYLE
(CONTINUING TO TAKE OUT PARAPHERNALIA)
Well, the price includes the Dimoxinil
Action Set: a six month supply of the
drug, gravity boots, scalp massager and
tee shirt.


The Tee shirt says "I (Heart-shape) Dimoxinil". The heart
has hair growing on it.


DR. BOYLE
(CONT'D)
Everything you need for your dimoxinil
regimen,

HOMER
But I can't afford that.


The doctor takes out a bottle of "Hair In A Drum" marked
$19.95.


TABLE DRAFT
3/21/90 PAGE 6


DR.
BOYLE
Well, we do have a product which is
more in your price range. However, I
assure you any hair growth you
experience while using it will be
purely coincidental.

HOMER
Oh, of all the rip-off -- screw job --
gyp joint... (CRYING) forget you, pal!


Thanks for nothing!


Homer storms out, opening the door with a big shove.


INT. NUCLEAR POWER PLANT - CAFETERIA - DAY


Homer is sitting at a table with LENNY and CARL. They are
eating fish sticks, dipping them in tiny cardboard cups of
tartar sauce.


HOMER
So I say (TOUGH VOICE) "Forget you,
pal! Thanks for nothing!", and I storm
right out of there.

LENNY


That's telling him, Homer.


Homer uses the last of his tartar sauce. He turns the cup
inside out and wipes it on a fish stick.


HOMER
(ANNOYED GRUNT) Out of tartar sauce.
Hey Lenny, are you gonna use all your
tartar sauce? Carl? Dry fish sticks.


This sucks.


Three annoying BUZZERS sound.


TABLE DRAFT
3/21/90 PAGE 7


CARL
Well, back to work.
LENNY
Was that an hour?
We PAN with Homer, Carl and Lenny as they walk GRUMBLING
as they walk to their work area, heading straight for the
coffee stand. There is a change box next to it and a sign
reading, "Honor System - Coffee refills 25 cents." During
the following, Lenny fills a cup and puts a quarter in the
box, as does Carl.
HOMER
A thousand bucks! That stuff must be
great! It's no fair.


Homer looks both ways, fills his cup and does not put a
quarter into the box.


LENNY
Hey Homer, don't be a sap all your
life. Just fill out a few forms
creatively and charge it to the
company.

HOMER
But that would be dishonest.

LENNY
Well, you didn't pay for your coffee.
(POINTS TO SIGN) What about the honor


system?


TABLE DRAFT
3/21/90 PAGE 8


HOMER
They got the honor, and I got the
system. (CHUCKLES) But, a thousand
bucks... Burns would can my butt in no
time flat.

LENNY
Ooooh, a thousand bucks. So what? To
Mr. Burns, that's one less ivory back
scratcher. To you, it's no more guys
callin' you shinehead.

CARL


And chrome dome.


LENNY
And Kojak.

CARL
And cue-ball.

HOMER


You're right. I'm through being a
hypocrite. If I'm gonna steal twenty-
five cents worth of coffee, I might as
well steal a thousand bucks for
dimoxinil.

INT. SPRINGFIELD MALL -

Homer is again at Dr. Boyle's counter.

HOMER
I was wondering... if maybe I could
charge dimoxinil to my health
insurance?
Dr. Boyle puts his hand over a security camera.
DR.
BOYLE
You wearing a wire?
HOMER
No.
DR.
BOYLE
All right. You don't look like a cop.
Come with me.


Dr. Boyle leads Homer into his back office. As triumphant
MUSIC
plays, we see a montage:


A.
In a dimly-lit back room, Dr. Boyle signs an
authorization form and shakes Homer's hand.


B.
Homer proudly strides out of Dr. Boyle's office carrying
a bottle of dimoxinil. He kisses it.

HOMER
(PRAYING) Hey, big guy, I know this
seems like a petty request, but, hey,
you got that big white beard and that
glorious head of hair down to your
shoulders like Michael Landon. All I'm
asking is for you to share the wealth.
DISSOLVE
TO:
INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - MORNING
Homer wakes up and walks into the bathroom. He opens the
medicine cabinet, takes out a bottle of green mouthwash and
takes a big swig. As Homer, HUMMING, swishes the mouthwash
around in his mouth, he takes off the nightcap. A thick mop
of brown hair falls out. Homer has curls down to his
shoulders. Homer GASPS. His jaw drops open and the
mouthwash runs down his chin.
HOMER
(WHISPERS) I have hair!... (LOUD) I
have hair!
Homer runs out of the room.
EXT. SIMPSON HOUSE
= CONTINUOUS
The door bursts open and Homer flies out, still in his
pajamas. He bounds down the walkway and runs down the
street. Morning is breaking, birds are SINGING and church
bells are RINGING.
HOMER
I have hair! Look! Look!
EXT. WINFIELD'S HOUSE

OLD MAN WINFIELD
and MRS. WINFIELD are seated on the porch.
Homer runs by in his pajamas. They wave to each other.

HOMER
Good morning, statue of our town
founder!
A man waiting in traffic leans out his car window.
MAN IN
CAR
Why don't you get a haircut, you
hippie?
Homer stops and kisses the man.
HOMER
I've been waiting twenty years for
someone to tell me that!


Homer stops and bangs on the window of Moe's Tavern. The
regulars, including BARNEY, have already started drinking.


HOMER
(CONT'D)
Good morning, Moe's Tavern!
BARNEY


It's the President!

HOMER
Good morning, everybody! Isn't it a
wonderful morning?
MOURNERS
Good morning!
EXT. SPRINGFIELD ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - CONTINUOUS
Homer is running home when another yell stops him.
OTHER RUNNER
(V.0.)
Good morning, everybody! Good morning!
Another man appears, also in his pajamas, also with long
hair. He stops when he sees Homer. The two men point at
each other.
OTHER RUNNER
(CONT'D)
Dimoxinil!


Homer and the Other Runner jump up and down and SCREAM
victory screams.


EXT. SIMPSON HOUSE
~ CONTINUOUS


The sequence takes place in slow motion. Marge, Bart, Lisa,
Maggie and Santa's Little Helper are waiting at the door.
We see Lisa point down the street. The Simpsons see Homer
as he runs toward them. Lawn sprinklers erupt in triumph as
he goes by, forming a rainbow in the morning light. The
Theme from "The Natural" PLAYS. Marge gasps and puts her
hands to her face. Bart, Lisa and the dog slowly jump up
and down, the kids pumping their fists in the air. Their
yells to Homer are also mechanically slowed down.


BART


YaaaaayyyYYYYYYYYYYYY,


Daaaaaaaaaaaaaaadddddd!

MAGGIE
(SLOWED-DOWN SUCK)
As Homer reaches the family, Santa's Little Helper jumps on
him and Homer falls into the flower bed. Bart and Lisa pile
on top of him and they roll in the dirt, laughing.
INT. JAKE'S UNISEX HAIR PALACE = DAY


Despite the name, Jake's Unisex Hair Palace is a dump.
Homer walks in and is greeted by JAKE.


JAKE
Homer Simpson! You haven't been here in
twenty years! Hey, you got rid of the
sideburns.
Homer CHUCKLES and sits in Jake's chair.
HOMER
Gimme the usual.
INT. SIMPSON HOUSE -
EVENING


Marge is sitting on the couch with Patty and Selma, showing
them the bottle of dimoxinil.


MARGE
He's much happier at work and, just
between us girls... well, he hasn't
been this frisky in years.
Selma SNORTS.

Marge lets out a shocked GASP.
MARGE
(V.0.)
Homie, my sisters are here.
HOMER
(V.0O.)
Ah, dinner with three beautiful women.
I'm in heaven.
Homer and Marge enter. Homer has his hair cut in a big Roy
Orbison-style bowl. Patty's and Selma's jaws drop. They
preen themselves and rush over to him.
SELMA
This is Homer?
PATTY
Oh, my.
SELMA
Stop drooling, Patty.
PATTY
Look who's talking.
INT. NUCLEAR POWER PLANT - DAY
Homer walks up to the coffee machine and hangs up his hard
hat, his hair popping out as he does so. Lenny and Carl are
hanging around the machine. Homer looks both ways, then
pours himself some coffee without putting any money into
the honor system change box.
CARL
Hey, you're looking pretty snazzy these
days, Homer. What'd you do, drop a few


pounds?

Homer CHUCKLES. The picture turns black and white and we
PULL BACK
to see we are watching a monitor.


INT. NUCLEAR POWER PLANT - MR. BURNS! OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
MR. BURNS
and SMITHERS are watching Carl drinking coffee on
a security monitor. As Smithers flicks from camera to
camera, the monitor shows a series of workers gabbing,
eating donuts or sneaking a smoke behind some machinery.
Burns clenches his fists.
BURNS
Morons! Pathetic morons in my employ,
stealing my precious money. This is
hopeless! None of these cretins deserve
a promotion.
SMITHERS
It's in the union contract, sir.
BURNS
Wait. Who is that young go-getter?

Well, it sort of looks like Homer

resourceful.

Attention employees: one of your lowly
ilk has a chance for a better life.
Homer Simpson, you have been promoted.
A look of disbelief on Homer's face turns to joy.
HOMER
Wow, me an executive. Hey hey!
He takes his hat and flings it. It flies through the air
and smashes a readout monitor. Sparks fly out. Homer does
a victory dance.
SMITHERS
(V.0.)
Report to the executive wing within
five minutes, or you will be fired.
That is all.


Homer stops in mid-dance and runs across the plant floor,
fists raised.

INT. NUCLEAR POWER PLANT - HOMER'S OFFICE - DAY
Homer is at his desk dressed in a baggy light green suit
with a flower in the lapel. His hair has grown even
bigger. He is interviewing a WOMAN APPLICANT, reading
questions off a paper. The woman is making seductive faces
at Homer.
HOMER
Well, your resume seems in order. Do
you have any other secretarial skills I
should know about?
WOMAN
APPLICANT
I give great back rubs to harried


executives. Let me show you.


She approaches Homer, but Homer stands up quickly and
crosses to the door, opening it.


HOMER

(NERVOUSLY) No, no, that will be fine,

thank you. I've got a wife who gives

me back rubs. Well, she doesn't give

me back rubs, but I do have a wife who,

in theory, could give me back rubs.

Anyway, the point I'm trying to make

is, thank you, goodbye.

A young man walks into the roon.
KARL
Hello, Mr. Simpson. I'm Karl.
MARGE
(INTO PHONE) Hire him. He sounds

I'll call you back, Marge.


Smithers sticks his head in the door as Homer hangs up the
phone. Homer cowers.


SMITHERS
Simpson! Meeting in the board room
tomorrow at two. Just keep quiet,
listen and learn. Got it?

Yes, Mr. Smithers.

HOMER
Huh?

KARL
You don't belong here. You're a fraud
and a phony and it's only a matter of
time until they find you out.

HOMER
Who told you?

KARL
You did! You told me with the way you
slump your shoulders, the way you avert
my glance and talk into your chest, the
way you smother yourself in bargain
basement lime-green polyester. I want
you to say to yourself: I deserve this!
I love it! I am nature's greatest

KARL
Let's go shopping.
INT. SPRINGFIELD MALL -
DAY
We see Homer and Karl inside a store marked "Royal Majesty.
For the Obese or Gangly Gentleman." There are eight-foot-
high mirrors on the wall, along with very tall or extremely
fat mannequins. One sign advertises "Belts: $8.99 a yard";
another warns "You rip it, you buy it"; a chest-size
conversion chart runs all the way up to "62-64....XXXXXXL".


Homer takes a powder blue suit off the "2 for $99" sale
rack and shows it to Karl.


HOMER
Ooh. Beauty.


Karl snatches the suit away and puts it back on the rack.


TABLE DRAFT
3/21/90 PAGE 21


KARL
A man's suit should make him feel like
a prince, and captivate the
imaginations of those around him. It
should cry out to the world, "Here I
am!" A bargain suit that does not do
that is no bargain.

HOMER
So which do you like?

KARL
None of these suits will do. (CALLING
TO
CLERK) Sir, we need to speak with
your finest tailor. And we are opening
a charge account.

DISSOLVE

Soon after, Homer is in his underwear and socks. A TAILOR
is measuring his inseam.


HOMER
Ooh, I like this.
KARL
Style is an elegant way of living that
distinguishes persons of taste.
HOMER
Say the quality one again.
KARL
Quality is what separates the


magnificent from the mediocre.

Jake is sitting in his chair reading the paper when Homer
and Karl enter.


KARL
(TO JAKE) Sir, Mister Simpson paid you
good money to style his hair. Your work
was shoddy and amateurish. Something
simple and dignified, please. (TO
HOMER) I'll be next door buying some
hosiery.
Karl exits.
JAKE
So, what is it you want, Homer?
Homer points to a black-bordered portrait of John F.
Kennedy with the inscription "...Ask what you can do for
your country. 1917-1963." It is hanging on the wall next to
several photos of men modeling hairstyles.
HOMER
Give me one like that guy.
DISSOLVE
TO:
Twenty minutes later, Homer has a John F. Kennedy haircut.
Karl walks in with an array of knee-length socks and
attached garters over his arm. Homer gives him a big
smile.


HOMER


What do you think?

(TO JAKE) No. This will not be

scissors.
Karl starts to cut Homer's hair. Homer looks disappointed.
INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING
Marge is cooking breakfast, spraying her pan with a non-
stick lubricant before pouring from a carton of pre-mixed

BURNS
Fish sticks? What are you talking
about?
HOMER
Well, sir, they cut the head off a fish
and chop up the rest into sticks, and
then put seasoned bread crumbs on then.
BURNS
I know what fish sticks are! Get to

Homer bows his way to the door. As he leaves, he passes
Smithers entering. Smithers grins at Homer as he closes the

Mr. Burns, it is my sad duty to report
that one of your executives has bilked
the company insurance plan out of a

strangers. Can you possibly

HOMER
I think so. Does this mean I have to
give back the key to that nice


bathroom?

BURNS
Yes. Yes, it does.
HOMER
I was afraid of that. (HANDS BACK KEY)
Goodbye, sir.
BURNS
Goodbye, Simpson.
Homer leaves. Burns looks small and alone in his office.
BURNS
(CONT'D)
Goodbye... my friend. (WHISPERS) My
friend!
INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - EVENING
Homer and Marge are in bed.
HOMER
Marge, I don't understand. You're being
so nice about this.
MARGE
Homer, I don't want you to ever feel
that you have to change anything about
yourself for my sake. I love you just
the way you are.
Homer kisses Marge.
HOMER
Good night, Marge.
MARGE
Good night, Homer.


They close their eyes. Homer turns off the light. We hear
the RUSTLING of sheets.

(FIRMLY) I said good night, Homer.
We see Homer's eyes staring into space.

BART SELLS HIS
SOUL
by

Greg Daniels
ACT
ONE

EXT. ESTABLISHING - SPRINGFIELD CHURCH - SUNDAY MORNING

The church marquee reads: "No Shoes--No Shirt--No
Salvation." FAMILIES enter wearing their Sunday best.

INT. SPRINGFIELD CHURCH - VESTIBULE - CONTINUOUS

BART
holds a basket labelled "Today's Hymns." Each person
takes a xeroxed handout from it as they enter.

BART

Hymns here! I got hymns here! Get 'em
while they're holy! Fresh from God's
brain to your mouth! (SNEAKY CHUCKLE)

INT. SPRINGFIELD CHURCH - A LITTLE LATER

REV.
LOVEJOY

And now please rise for our opening

hymn... (CONSULTING HANDOUT) Uh,

"Stairway to Heaven" by "Ed Zeppelin?"

At the organ, MRS. FISCHE puts on her bifocals and begins
sight-reading the sheet music.

CONGREGATION

(SINGING) There's a lady who's sure /

All that glitters is gold / And she's
buying a stairway to heaven.

DISSOLVE
TO:


INT. CHURCH - TEN MINUTES LATER


Mrs. Fische is rocking out at the organ, but she doesn't
look too happy about it.

CONGREGATION

(SINGING) And as we wind on down the
road / Our shadows taller than our soul
/ There walks a lady we all know...

REV. LOVE
JOY

(TO HIMSELF) Wait a minute -- This
sounds like rock and/or roll.

A beach ball CAROMS off his head.


DISSOLVE
TO:


INT. CHURCH - A MINUTE LATER

The exhausted, swaying congregation finishes up. Several
members hold up lit votive candles.


CONGREGATION

And she's buy-ing a stairway...
FLANDERS

(EXTREME FALSETTO) to -- Heav-en.

HOMER

(AFTER A BEAT, THEN SINGS) Wanna whole
lotta love. (DESCENDING GUITAR SOUND)
Wanna whole lotta love... (SCAT


SINGING)


SMASH CUT
TO:

INT. LOVEJOY'S OFFICE - A FEW MINUTES LATER

Rev. Lovejoy, furious, has all the children lined up and is
angrily waving the xeroxed handout.



ju/ js rayc o.


REV.
LOVEJOY

I know one of you is responsible for
this. So repeat after me: If I
withhold the truth, may I go straight
to hell, where I will eat naught but
burning hot coals and drink naught but
burning hot cola...

CUT
around the room to see children repeating after him.

RALPH

(SCARED)... where fiery demons will
punch me in the back...

BART

(NONCHALANT) ...where my soul will be
chopped into confetti and strewn upon a
^ parade of murderers and single

mothers...

MILHOUSE

(NERVOUS) ...where my tongue will be

torn out by ravenous birds...

Milhouse glances nervously out the window to see a CROW
sitting on a branch. It suddenly whips its head around 180
degrees and stares directly at Milhouse.

CROW

(HELLISH SHRIEK)

MILHOUSE

(CRACKING) Bart did it! That Bart right there!

REV.
LOVEJOY

Milhouse, you did the right thing.

Bart, come with me for punishment. (TO
MILHOUSE) You too, Snitchy.

INT. CHURCH - A PEW MINUTES LATER

Rev. Lovejoy, Milhouse, and Bart stand in front of the
organ.

REV.
LOVEJOY

I want you to clean every one of these
organ pipes that you have befouled with
your "popular music."

He hands them a variety of long, thin brushes and walks
off. They begin listlessly snaking the brushes up into the
pipes.

BART

You shank. How could you tell on me?

MILHOUSE

Well, I didn't want hungry birds
pecking my soul forever.

BART

Soul? Come on. C'mon, Milhouse.

There's no such thing as a soul. It's
just something they made up to scare
kids, like the Boogeyman or Michael
Jackson.

MILHOUSE

But every religion says there's a soul,

Bart. Why would they lie? What would
they have to gain?



Jl'UA

C Vi —»


We see a business-like Rev. Lovejoy in his office emptying
the collection plate into a CHURNING, Vegas-style money
sorter.

REV.
LOVEJOY

(SING-SONG) I don't hear scrubbing.

BART

Well, if your soul's real, where is it?

MILHOUSE

(RUBBING CHEST) It's kinda in here.

(THEN BUILDING CONFIDENCE) And when you
sneeze, that's your soul trying to
escape. Saying "God bless you" crams
it back in. And when you die, it
squirms out and flies away.

BART

Uh huh. What if you die in a submarine
at the bottom of the ocean?

MILHOUSE

(SMUG) Oh, it can swim. It's even got
wheels, in case you die in the desert
and it has to drive to the cemetery.

BART

(DISDAINFUL) How can someone with
glasses that thick be so stupid?

Listen. You don't have a soul, I don't
have a soul, there's no such thing as a
soul.

Milhouse simmers silently for a beat, then...



MILHOUSE


Fine. (CAGEY) If you're so sure about
that, why don't you sell your soul to
me.


BART

(BEAT) How much you got?

MILHOUSE

Five bucks.


BART


Deal.

CLOSE UP
on a sheet of Church stationery with Bart's hand
writing the words "Bart Simpson's Soul." PULL BACK to see
Bart give it to Milhouse.

BART
(CONT'D)^

There you go: one soul.

Bart smells the bill happily then pockets it.
Simultaneously, Milhouse carefully folds the soul, puts it
in his shirt pocket and pats it.

MILHOUSE

Pleasure doing business with you.

BART

Any time, chummmmm.. .p.

INT. STATION WAGON - THAT AFTERNOON SCENE 2

DR. HIBBERT
and his FAMILY are out for a drive.

DR.
HIBBERT

All right, where would you kids like to
eat tonight?


PRE-TEEN HIBBERT
KID
The Spaghetti Laboratory!



LITTLE HIBBERT
GIRL

FaceStuffers!

TEENAGE HIBBERT
BOY
Professor V.J. Cornucopia's Fantastic
Foodmagorium and Great American
Steakery!

DR.
HIBBERT

(CHUCKLES) Well,' what about this place?

(READING SIGN) "Moe's."

His car pulls up in front of Moe's.

INT. MOE'S - A MINUTE LATER

It's a typically dismal scene as HOMER, BARNEY, CARL, and
the BARFLIES slump on the bar. One SOBS softly. As the
Hibberts enter, a shaft of light shoots in from the door
and hits Barney.

BARNEY

(FLAILING) Agh! Natural light! Get
it off me! Get it off me!

DR.
HIBBERT

(LOOKING AROUND) Oh, I'm sorry. I
thought this was a family restaurant.

MOE

(LYING) Oh, it is. It is. Just, uh,
pull them stools up to the pool table.

LITTLE HIBBERT
GIRL
Daddy, this place smells like tinkle.

DR.
HIBBERT

Mmm-hmm, I think we'll just go to The
Texas Cheesecake Depository.

The Hibberts exit.


MOE

Everybody is goin' to family
restaurants these days. Seems nobody
wants to hang out in a dank pit no
more.

CARL

Ya ain't thinking of gettin' rid of the
dank, are ya?

MOE

Uh, maybe I am. There's no future in
watching you guys drink yourselves into
an early grave, entertaining as that
might be.

CARL

Oh, but Moe, the dank, the dank.

MOE

•(LOST IN THOUGHT) Yeah. Family
restaurants. That's where the big
bucks are.

The barflies MURMUR in disbelief. The sobbing one SOBS
even louder.


BARFLIES

Family restaurant? / What about us? /
You're scaring us, Moe! / Come on / Can
we still get our mail here?



MOE


I could turn this joint into a place
where you wouldn't be ashamed to bring
your family, huh?

HOMER

I'm not ashamed.

Homer pulls MAGGIE out from under his stool. She has a
cocktail parasol sticking out of her mouth. It opens and
closes as she SUCKS. He plops her down on top of the bar.

MOE

Hey, put a coaster under that.

EXT. SIMPSON HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - DAY

Bart opens a package labelled "DinoSponges" with a cartoon
dinosaur saying: "Dampen me for dinosaur terror." He
gingerly pulls out a dried dinosaur sponge as if it is a
high explosive. He sets it on the driveway and picks up a
hose.


BART

(SNEAKY) Oh, Li-sa. There's a little
present for you lying in the driveway.

LISA
(O.S.)

(EXCITED) Oh boy! Really?

BART'S
FANTASY

Bart sprays the sponge with a hose. It instantly grows
into a 70-foot T-Rex which ROARS and seizes LISA in its
j aws.


DINOSAUR
(SPONGY GUMMING SOUNDS)

LISA

Nooooo! It's dripping funny-smelling


water all over me!



Bart SNICKERS.


BACK TO
REALITY

As Lisa approaches, Bart sprays the sponge. It slowly,
undramatically increases in size by thirty percent and is
washed into the gutter.

BART

(GROANS) I wasted five bucks on these.

LISA

Where'd you get five bucks? I want
five bucks.

BART

(PROUDLY) I sold my soul to Milhouse.

LISA

What? How could you do that? Your soul
is the most valuable part of you!

BART

You believe in that junk?

LISA

Well, whether or not the soul is
physically real, Bart, it's the symbol
of everything fine inside us.

BART

(TSK SOUNDS) Poor gullible Lisa. I'll
keep my crappy sponges, thanks.



LISA


Bart, your soul is the only part of you
that lasts forever. For five dollars,

Milhouse could own you for a zillion
years.

BART

Well, if you think he got such a good
deal, I'll sell you my conscience for
four-fifty.

Lisa shakes her head and starts to leave..

BART
(CONT'D)

I'll throw in my sense of decency, too.

It's a Bart sales event! Everything
about me must go!

INT. BART'S ROOM - A FEW MINUTES LATER

SANTA'S LITTLE HELPER
is lying on the floor, peacefully.
Bart enters.


BART


Hey, boy. How ya doin'?

Bart bends over to pet the dog.

SANTA'S LITTLE
HELPER
(SUSPICIOUS GROWL)


Bart backs away.


BART
(CONT'D)


Man, what's gotten into you?
He walks by the CAT.


SNOWBALL
II


(SUSPICIOUS HISS)



BART


Geez. You're pretty uppity for someone
who eats bugs all day.

The cat COTJGHS up a spider, which skitters away.

EXT. KWIK-E-MART - LATER THAT AFTERNOON

Bart walks up and SMACKS into the automatic door, which
doesn't open.

BART

(SMUSHED FACE) Stupid automatic door.

ROD
and TODD walk up, and the door immediately opens for
them.

ROD
/ TODD
Thank you, door.

Bart frowns and slips inside.

INT. KWIK-E-MART - ICE CREAM FREEZER - CONTINUOUS

JIMBO, DOLPH and KEARNEY are leaning on the ice cream
freezer. Bart walks up. Jimbo leans over and breathes on
the freezer door until it fogs up, then writes "BITE ME."

DOLPH

Ha! Some ice cream guy's gonna see
that and it'll blow his mind.

BART

Let me try.

Bart BREATHES on the glass, but it won't fog up.

JIMBO

Way to breathe, No-Breath.

Bart looks uneasy. He turns to leave and BANGS into
the door again, leaving a smudge.

BART

(SMUSHED FACE) This is getting weird.

EXT. MOB'S - DAY SCENE 3

A banner reads: "COMING SOON -- FAMILY RESTAURANT."

INT. MOB'S -
CONTINUOUS

Moe has started to renovate. Sheets are thrown over the
bar, etc. He is reading a book called "'Your Gimmicky
Restaurant' by Bennigan and Fuddrucker" and talking with
Homer and a Barney-shaped form under one of the sheets.

MOE

So come on. I need a name that says
friendly, all-American cooking.

HOMER

How about Chairman Moe's Magic Wok?

BARNEY-SHAPED
FORM

I like it!

MOE

Nah. I want something that says people
can have a nice, relaxing time.

HOMER

I got it! Madman Moe's Pressure
Cooker!

BARNEY-SHAPED
FORM


I like it!



MOE


(SNAPS FINGERS, INSPIRED) Hey, how
about Uncle Moe's Family Feedbag?

BARNEY-SHAPED
FORM

I hate it.

From outside we hear a truck PULL UP and HONK.

MOE

Oh boy. The deep fryer's here.

EXT. MOE'S -
CONTINUOUS

Homer, Moe, and Barney run out and see an enormous cast
iron deep fryer resting on a truck bed. Stencilled on the
fryer is "U.S.S. Missouri -- C DECK MESS."

MOE

I got it used from the Navy. You can
flash-fry a buffalo in forty seconds.

HOMER

Forty seconds? (WHINING) But I want
it now.

INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - TV ROOM - DAY

Bart and Lisa watch TV.

ON
TV

ITCHY AND
SCRATCHY

The title card reads: "Itchy and Scratchy in 'Skinless in
Seattle.'"

We PAN across a beautiful Seattle skyline and down to
Scratchy, who is holding a bouquet of flowers and a note
saying: "Meet Me At The Space Needle (signed with a
heart)." He stops at a big X, SIGHS lovingly, and hearts
float upward to the top of the Space Needle, where we see
Itchy.





Itch Y sees a sign that says "Do Not Throw Pennies From The
Tower," gets an idea, takes a penny out of his loafer and
r drops it. Lincoln screams in horror as it picks up speed.

i The penny misses the love-struck Scratchy and SIZZLES into

the sidewalk.

Itchy, frustrated, runs to a souvenir stand, scoops up
armfuls of mini Space Needles and hurls them down. They
land in a heart formation around Scratchy. Scratchy SIGHS
contentedly and oozes more hearts.

We hear SAWING sounds and see the entire top of the Space
Needle, including the restaurant, SNAP off as Itchy SAWS
off the last support. It starts to fall toward Scratchy,
who is oblivious as the giant shadow widens over him. At
the last moment, he looks up to see the Needle heading

towards him. It impales him right through the eye
and he runs back and forth in pain as a few hearts ooze out
of him. SUPER: Sponsored by Seattle Chamber of Commerce.

ANGLE ON BART AND
LISA

Lisa is LAUGHING hard. Bart stares at the screen, a little
bewildered.

BART

(TAPPING HEAD) I know that's funny, but
I'm just not laughing.

LISA

Hmmm... Pablo Neruda said laughter is
the language of the soul.

BART

(DEFENSIVE) I'm familiar with the works
of Pablo Neruda.

LISA

I think we should do a test.

She ROLLS his skateboard into the hall. A beat later, a
SINGING
Homer walks by and SLIPS on it. He pitches forward
and WEDGES his head in between the banisters.

HOMER

LISA

BART

(FORCES A WEAK LAUGH; THEN, WORRIED)

Nope. I don't feel a thing.

LISA

That's creepy, Bart. I think you
really did lose your soul.

Santa's Little Helper runs up and bites Homer in the ass.

HOMER

(PAINED BEWILDERED GROANS)


Lisa looks at Bart.


BART


Nothing.

FADE OUT.
Over black we hear:

HOMER
(O.S.)


(WEAKLY) Help me. Why isn't anybody
helping me?

IN: SCENE 4

INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - KIDS' BATHROOM - DAY

Bart is standing on the scale.

LISA

Hram... You've lost 1/4 of an ounce,
(SPOOKY) exactly the weight of a
child's soul.

BART

Oh, come on, Lise, that scale's not
that accurate.

Homer walks in and steps on the scale.

HOMER

(MOAN) Oh, I've gained a hundredth of
an ounce. Stupid tequila worm went
right to my hips.

Homer exits.

LISA

Bart, the evidence is clear. You don't
have a soul.

BART

(DEFENSIVE) Yeah, well it's clear you
don't have a brain.

LISA

You'd better get that soul back.

BART


You'd better get that brain back.



LISA


(FED UP) Forget it.

BART

Brainget it.

LISA

(IRRITATED NOISE)

She exits.


BART

(DEFIANTLY) So, I lost a little weight.

I feel fine. I'm solid as a rock.

He pats himself on the chest and it makes a strange HOLLOW
SOUND.
He then THUNKS his belly. It sounds like an
overripe watermelon.

BART
(CONT'D)

Uh-oh.

INT. SIMPSONS - LIVING ROOM - LATER

We still hear a variety of HOLLOW THUNKING sounds coming
from upstairs. Homer, oblivious, is watching TV.

ON COMMERCIAL ON
TV

We see Moe's bar is now decorated in kooky Chili's-style
manner (old gas station fixtures, tools, an old sled,
license plates, a cigar store Indian, a stuffed jackalope,
a stuffed alligator with a cowboy hat, a player piano,
etc.) and is packed with happy families. Moe approaches
the camera dressed in gay '90's attire, sporting a
handlebar mustache, and with his hair parted in the middle.

MOE

If you like good food, good fun, and a
whole lotta crazy crap on the walls,
then come on down to "Uncle Moe's
Family Feedbag."



A shot of a delicious, fresh-looking turkey dinner with all
the trimmings (glass of wine, salad, etc.) on a tray.

ANNOUNCER
(V.O.)

(MASON ADAMS VOICE) At Moe's, we serve
good old-fashioned home cooking...
deep fried to perfection.

The tray is lowered into the deep fryer, and comes out a
brown, crispy mass. A CUSTOMER breaks off a piece, tries
it, and gives Moe a thumbs up.

MOE
(CONT'D)

Now that's "Moe" like it. (WINKS AT
CAMERA) So bring the whole family -
mom, dad, kids. Uh, no old people.

They're not covered by our insurance.

It's fun! And remember our guarantee:

If I'm not smiling when your check
comes, your meal's on me, Uncle Moe.

Moe smiles grotesquely, and keeps smiling as we hear the

JINGLE.

JINGLERS

Come to Uncle Moe's for family fun /

It's good, good, good, good, good,
good, good.

ANGLE
ON


HOMER

Mmm. Sounds good.

EXT. VAN HOUTEN HOUSE - FRONT STEPS - LATER THAT DAY


MRS. VAN HOUTEN
has answered the door.



BART


Hi, is Milhouse home?

MRS. VAN
HOUTEN

(GESTURES AROUND BACK) He's playing in
the dirt with his army men...

Bart starts to head around to the back of the house.

MRS. VAN HOUTEN
(CONT'D)

... oh, and a white piece of paper, I
believe.

BART

(GASPS)

He dashes toward the back yard.

EXT. VAN HOUTEN HOUSE - BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS

Bart runs into the backyard to see Milhouse playing with
his plastic soldiers and Bart's soul.

MILHOUSE

(GRUFF VOICE) Cover me, Sarge! I'm

going after Bart's soul. (MAKES

SHOOTING
NOISES, THEN IN ACCENT) If the

Ayatollah can't have it, no one can!

Milhouse, making ENGINE SOUNDS, runs a toy tank back and
forth over the soul. Bart winces.

BART

(JUMPY) Ah, you know, Milhouse --
MILHOUSE

(FRANK NELSON SMUG) Yeesss?



BART


k


Bet you're getting tired of that soul,
huh?


MILHOUSE

(FRANK NELSON SMUG) NOOOOO.

BART

Suppose someone wanted to Jbuv it from
you?

MILHOUSE

Oh, you want to buy it back, Bart?
Sure. No problem...

Bart looks relieved.

MILHOUSE
(CONT'D)

(COLD) ...Fifty bucks.

BART


What?!


MILHOUSE


Who's stupid now? Huh? (STUPID


MILHOUSE
LAUGH)

Bart walks away.

INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - BART'S BEDROOM - THAT NIGHT
MARGE HUMS
as she tucks Bart in and hugs him.

MARGE


Hmm. Bart, what's wrong? There's
something a little off about your hug.

MARGE

(CUTS HIM OFF) Uh, uh, uh, let me
guess. A mother can always tell.

(HUGS HIM AGAIN) Hmm, it's not fear of
nuclear war. (BEAT) Hmm, it's not swim
test anxiety. (BEAT) It almost feels
like you're missing something.

Something important.

BART

(BRIGHTENING) Like I don't have a soul?
MARGE

(LAUGHS) Aw, honey, you're not a
monster .

ANGLE ON
BART
He looks crestfallen.


DISSOLVE
TO:


BART

tossing and turning in bed.

BART'S
DREAM:

EXT. SPRINGFIELD CENTRAL
PARK

As Bart approaches the park, he hears SOUNDS of kids having
fun. As he gets closer, he sees that each child is playing
with their own soul (a milky-white ghostly version of.
themselves) . He sees kids and their souls themselves) .

pushing each other on swings, riding bicycles built for two
and having chicken fights.

Bart sold his soul and that's just

swell / Now he's going straight to

Hell-o operator, give me number nine /

And if you disconnect me. I'll...

Their SINGING and LAUGHTER continue. Bart looks hurt.
Nelson runs up.

NELSON

No soul, huh? Don't worry. I'm still
behind you.

We see Nelson's soul crouched down behind Bart. Nelson
pushes Bart over.

NELSON AND HIS
SOUL

Haw-haw!

Martin and HIS SOUL, in matching sailor outfits, run down
to the shore of a lake and stand by a bunch of rowboats.

MARTIN

Ahoy there, friends! Everybody find a
first mate!


MARTIN'S
SOUL

choose Martin!

They hop into a rowboat, each grabbing an oar, and row off.
Other kids and their souls follow and head off toward a
glowing Emerald City on the other side of the lake.

Milhouse runs by, hand-in-hand with his own soul and Bart's
soul. The souls get on the bench and do all the rowing as
Milhouse relaxes in the back of the boat. Bart tries to
follow, but without a soul to grab the other oar, he can
only row around and around in a circle.



BART


" Wait! Wait for me!

The Simpsons enter and survey the crazy decor.

MARGE

t An alligator with sunglasses? Now I've

* seen everything!

Moe greets them, dressed as in the commercial (without
mustache).

MOE

Hiya, folks! Welcome to Uncle Moe's!
(CHUCKING KIDS UNDER THE CHIN) Aw, look

celebrate."

SIRENS
wail as Moe runs out of the kitchen waving sparklers
and carrying the fries in a festive basket strapped to his
head.



MOE

(MANIC) Here ya go! Here I am! Uncle
Moe! Thank ya Ma'am! This'll be a
treat! Uncle Moe! Here I am! While
you eat!

Moe finishes his dance with a big flourish and kneels down
next to Rod, who begins slowly eating the.fries.

MOE
(CONT'D)

(FORCED SMILE) Please take the fries
off my head, kid. The basket is
extremely hot.

Why don't you try Moe's Hobo Chicken
Chili? I start with the best part --
the neck. (ENTICING) And then I add
secret hobo spices.

MARGE


Ooo, tres bien.

MOE


Yeah.

Moe turns around and is instantly hit in the head with a
barrage of water from Ralph Wiggum and his battery-operated
squirt gun.


RALPH

(EXCITED LAUGHTER)

MOE

(ANGRILY) Hey, what the hell are ya
doin', ya little freak --!


RALPH

(TERRIFIED WHIMPER)

Ralph looks shocked. Moe recovers his smile.

MOE


I'm sorry, kid. Sorry. I'm not used
to the laughter of children. It cuts
through me like a dentist's drill.
(DRYING HIS FACE OFF) But no, no, that

The door CREAKS open to reveal a scary FIGURE in a space
suit.


FIGURE

(DEEP FILTERED BREATHING, THEN OMINOUS)

Leave this place. You are in great
danger.

BART

(SCARED) Where's Milhouse?

The one you call Milhouse is gone.

(REMOVES HELMET) (WISEGUY VOICE) He
went to his Gramma's while we're
spraying for potato bugs.

We PULL BACK. A striped extermination tent is draped over
the Van Houten house. (It reads "Circus of Death
Extermination Co.")

HIT. MOB'S RESTAURANT - SAME EVENING

A weary, bedraggled Moe struggles out of the kitchen with
huge tray of food. The birthday ALARM goes off again.

MOE

Aw, God.

Moe laboriously sets the tray down and goes back into the
kitchen.

ANGLE
ON:

Sherri and Terri. They are sitting at a table in party
hats with some other little girls and their Moms. Moe
comes running over with his sparklers, fry hat, etc.

MOE

Here ya go! Here I am! Uncle Moe!

Thank ya Ma'am! This'll be a treat!

Uncle Moe! Here I am! While you eat!

SHERRI

Yay! Now do it for Terri.

We're twins/

MOE

(SIGHS, THEN LACKLUSTER) Here ya go.

Here I am. Eat your fries. Eat 'em.

He PLUNKS down the fries in front of Sherri and Terri. A
little BOY shoves a crayoned placemat at Moe.



LITTLE
BOY


Here's you.

The picture is of an ugly stick-figure Moe. Written across
the top is "Mr. Stinky." Moe looks hurt.

MOE

Ah geez, and ya got the stink lines and
everything.

Still upset, Moe PLUNKS JAILBIRD'S check down on his table.
Jailbird points to a poster of a smiling Moe with a word
balloon saying, "If I don't smile, you eat for free."

JAILBIRD

Uh, dude, you did not smile. We eat
for free. Come on Shoshanna, let's

roll. (CHUCKLES)

Jailbird and his BIKER CHICK girlfriend get up to leave.

We hear the birthday ALARM again. Moe turns and sees Patty
and Selma sitting at a table wearing birthday hats. They
wave lasciviously.

PATTY AND
SELMA

EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET - LATE THAT NIGHT SCENE 8
Bart, on his bike, has stopped to look at a map.

BART

(FRANTIC) Okay, okay. Milhouse's
Gramma lives on 257th Street, and I'm
on Third. (MOANS)

He lowers the map. Suddenly, a street cleaner is just
inches away, coming directly at him, its bright lights
blinding and its HORN BLARING. Bart jumps off his bike and
tumbles onto the curb. As he watches in horror, the bike
is sucked under the street cleaner. There's a horrible
sound of metal GRINDING and SHREDDING, then the bike POPS
out completely unharmed and sparkling clean.

BART

Well, finally, a little luck.

Bart starts to ride again. The bike SQUEAKS twice, then
falls completely apart, still sparkling. The DRIVER leans
out of the street cleaner and looks back at Bart.

DRIVER

As he's looking in the wrong direction, the street cleaner
bumps down the stairs into a subway entrance, with HORRIBLE

RALPH

BART

(COMPLETE DISDAIN) Yes. A simple
proposition, Ralph: How would you like
to make a dollar?

RALPH

(INNOCENTLY) Uh, I don't know.

BART


All you have to do is sign a paper that
says I can have your soul. (INTENSELY)
I need a soul, Ralph. Any soul.

Yours.


RALPH

(WHIMPERS, STARTS TO CRY)

Ralph squirms in his seat belt as Bart starts to reach
toward him.

WIGGUM

Hey. What's goin' on over there?!

Wiggum shines his flashlight right in Bart's eyes. Bart
shields his face, cringes, and lopes off into the night.

BARNEY

You know, Moe, you might want to keep
the fire extinguishers.

MOE

Nah. Too many bad memories.

BARNEY

Well, look at the bright side, Moe.

You still got us.

better.

Why? That was the problem in the first
place. You were going broke because we

you were going broke... Moe?

Moe doesn't reply.

HOMER

Moe? Hey, Moe? Oh, you're thinking
about all the money you blew,
aren'tcha?


Moe nods sadly.

HOMER

What was it? 50-60 thousand dollars?

you went over all the mistakes you made
from the beginning... Moe?

MOE


What?


HOMER

Let me get a pad....

INT. GRAMMA VAN HOUTEN' S APT. - LATER THAT EVENING


It is a cramped apartment. Milhouse's parents are lying
uncomfortably on the fold-out couch with suitcases open on
the floor. Milhouse lies on a cot. The doorbell RINGS.
NANA VAN HOUTEN
bustles in.

NANA VAN

(MILHOUSEY VOICE) A caller at this
hour? (TO MR. VAN HOUTEN) You dial 9-
1, then when I say so, dial 1 again.

She opens the door to reveal a haggard-looking Bart.

BART

Milhouse, please.

MILHOUSE

Bart, I can't play now. It's two A.M.

Bart walks up and grabs Milhouse by his pajamas.

BART

Milhouse, I gotta have my soul back.

I'll do anything you want.

MILHOUSE

Uh... well...

MR. VAN
HOUTEN

(FROM SOFA-BED) Milhouse, give him back
his soul I I've got work tomorrow.

MILHOUSE

I'm really sorry. I kinda traded your
soul to the guy at the comic book
store. But look, I got some cool POGS.

Alf POGS. Remember Alf? He's back in
POG
form.


He pulls out a handful from his pajama pocket.



BART


(FURIOUS) You traded my soul for POGS?!
(DESPAIRING) Noooo!!

Bart runs off down the hall. Milhouse watches him go.

NANA VAN HOUTEN
(O.S.)

Oh, close that door. You're letting
fresh air in.

EXT. ESTABLISHING - ANDROID'S DUNGEON - DAWN SCENE 9

The sun's first light hits a lump on the stoop. It's Bart,
curled up, asleep. The COMIC BOOK GUY comes to open the
store.

COMIC BOOK
GUY

If you are waiting for the "Hi & Lois"
signing, it has been moved to the
Springfield Coliseum.

BART

Please. You have something of mine on
a little piece of paper.

COMIC BOOK

Oh, so you're Bart Simpson, eh?

INT. ANDROID'S DUNGEON -
CONTINUOUS
He opens the door and enters.

COMIC BOOK GUY
(CONT'D)

Well, since my breakfast burrito is
congealing rapidly, I will be blunt.

You're too late. I sold your soul last
night. (VOICE GETS EERIE) Yes, yes, I
found a buyer right away for that item.



BART


Who?

COMIC BOOK
GUY

I'm not at liberty to divulge the
party, but they were most interested in
having possession of a little boy's
soul.

Bart GROANS and BANGS his head on a cabinet.

COMIC BOOK
GUY

Excuse me. No banging your head on the
display case, please. It contains a
very rare "Mary Worth" in which she has
advised a friend to commit suicide.

Thank you.

EXT. SPRINGFIELD STREET -
MORNING

As Bart walks home it starts to rain.

INT. BART'S ROOM - A LITTLE LATER

Bart walks into his room, kneels by his bed, and prays.



BART


Are you there, God? It's me, Bart
Simpson. I know I never paid too much
attt. ‘.on in church, but I could really
use some of that good stuff now. I'm
afraid. I'm afraid some weirdo's got
my soul and I don't know what they're
doing to it. I just want it back.

Please. (STARTS TO CRY) I hope you can
hear this...

The soul flutters down onto the bed, ragged and a little
crumpled.

Bart looks up to see: Lisa.

BART

Lisa! You bought this?

LISA

With the change in my piggy bank.

BART

There's no change in your piggy bank.

LISA

Not in any of the ones you know about.

BART

Oh Lise, thank you.

Bart is so happy he KISSES her.





t t j •


LISA

Happy to do it. But you know, Bart,
some philosophers believe that nobody
is bora with a soul -- that you have to
earn one through suffering and thought
and prayer, like you did last night.

BART

(NOT LISTENING) Uh huh.

Bart is too busy cramming the paper into his mouth and
desperately trying to eat it. He finally swallows the last
bite with a RELIEVED GULP and crawls into bed.

INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - BART'S BEDROOM - A LITTLE LATER

Bart has fallen asleep, the dog and cat curled up on the
bed next to him.

BART'S
DREAM

A smiling Bart and his soul row contentedly across the
lake. They approach Martin's boat and ram it like a bumper
car. Martin's soul falls overboard.

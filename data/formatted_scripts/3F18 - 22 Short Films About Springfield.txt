and MILHOUSE SPIT on the CARS THAT PASS underneath.
BART
(PHILOSOPHIZING) Milhouse, d'you ever
think about the people in those cars?
MILHOUSE
I try not to. It makes it harder to
spit on ‘em.


As Bart speaks, we PULL BACK to see they have a wide,
sweeping panorama of all of Springfield.


BART
Sometimes I wonder about all the people
in this town. Do you think anything
interesting ever happens to them? I
mean, there must be thousands of great


stories out there.

BART
What do you think, Milhouse? Milhouse?


We see Milhouse is squirting an entire bottle of mustard
over the side.


MILHOUSE
Hunh? Oh, sorry, I saw a convertible.
You were saying?
BART
Forget it. C'mon, it's 11 o'clock. I
need some sugar.
They walk off the bridge and over to the Kwik-E-Mart .

As Bart and Milhouse enter, APU and SANJAY are in the
middle of a discussion.


SANJAY
I wish you'd come to my party, Apu.
You could use some merriment!

APU
Listen, serving the customer is
merriment enough for me.


Bart hands him some change for a pack of gum. (Bart and
Milhouse exit.)


APU
(CONT'D)
Thank you. Come again. (TO SANJAY)


You see? Most enjoyable.

SANJAY
Oh, I guarantee a wing-ding of titanic
proportions. You will be there or
kindly be square.

APU
(TEMPTED) Well... I don't like to
leave the store, but...


He reaches below the counter, pulls out a "Back in [BLANK]
Minutes" sign, and BLOWS the dust off it.


APU
(CONT'D)
For the next five minutes, I'm going to
party like it's on sale for $19.99!
He sets the sign to "Back in 5 Minutes" and puts it in the
window. As they run out, a DIGITAL COUNTDOWN begins in the


lower right corner of the screen.


The entire following scene takes place at a blistering
speed:


EXT. SANJAYS'S HOUSE - SECONDS LATER
The countdown reads "4:05." Apu and Sanjay dash up to a
swinging party. Sanjay throws on a chef's hat and apron
(that reads "IN MY NEXT LIFE, YOU'RE COOKING!") and tends
to a SIZZLING barbeque grill as Apu grabs still-cooking
tofu dogs off the grill.
APU

Quick! Quick! No time to cook them --

they will plump in my stomach!
Apu eats the hot dogs in seconds flat. He fishes a beer


out of a garbage can of ice, CHUGS it, and BELCHES. Then
he turns to an attractive INDIAN WOMAN.


3F18 FINAL 1 9/22/95 Page 4.


APU
(CONT'D)

Helloo, beautiful! (GRABS HER HAND)

No ring, I see. So, you are only

arranged to be married.

A FUNKY SONG
comes on the stereo. After one note...

APU
(CONT'D)

Ooh, ooh, ooh, I love this song. Let

us boogie!


He drags the woman in front of the D.J. and begins to
robot-dance. The crowd re-forms around them and CLAPS.


APU
(CONT'D)
(SINGING) I ama Freak-a-Zoid / Come
on and wind me up! (THEN, TO WOMAN)
Phew, I am hot. Let us get out of
here.
They run into the poolhouse. We HOLD on the door as


several seconds tick off the countdown, then Apu saunters
out, smoking a cigarette, his shirt on backwards and his


hair mussed.
APU
(CONT'D)
(CALLING BACK TO HER) Don't worry,
I'll tell everybody you were
untouchable.
Apu bumps into an ENGLISH BUTLER carrying a tray of drinks,
KNOCKING
him into the pool. He gives him a hand to help
him out and loses his balance. He grabs at a passing conga
line and drags everyone into the pool.

APU
(LAUGHING, THEN:) Oh, Sanjay, never
have I partied so hearty! Same time,

Sanjay (wearing the soggy chef's hat) gives him a high-
eeve:.-AgY runs dripping out of the pool and down the


INT. KWIK-E-MART - SECONDS
LATER


The countdown reads "01:03." Apu UNLOCKS the door, LEAPS
in, and looks at his watch.


APU
(PANTING) Made it! And with one
minute to spare!


Then he notices MOLEMAN, who has been locked inside the
store.


MOLEMAN
(INDIGNANT) You took four minutes of
my life and I want them back!
(DEFLATES) Oh, I'd only waste 'em
anyway...


Moleman shuffles out sadly. The CAMERA DRIFTS in to Apu's
radio playing MUZAK.


INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - KITCHEN - SIMULTANEOUS SCENE 2
MUSIC: THE SAME MUZAK ON THE RADIO
MARGE
sweeps a pile into a dustpan. She does it again, to
get the little bit left over. And again, to get that pesky
black line of dirt. And again, perpendicularly, until it's
just a dot of dirt. Then she picks up the dot with a
sponge and RINSES the sponge in the sink.
MARGE
(BORED SIGH)


An announcer breaks into the Muzak on the radio.

ANNOUNCER
(V.0.)
In the news, two more hostages, one
British, one French, have been captured
in Algeria. The United Nations is
working to free the British one.
MARGE
Tch, how awful... to be taken
hostage... (DELICIOUS SHUDDER)
MARGE'S
FANTASY
Three very good-looking, SWARTHY MEN, wearing checked
keffiyahs, are waving guns on a crowded bus. HOMER and
Marge cling together on one of the seats.
OMAR
The bus is ours. Let the terror begin.
Turn off the little fan!


One of the terrorists SHOOTS out the little bus fan in
front of the bus.


OMAR
(CONT'D)
(EVIL LAUGH) Now, let's take hostages.
YANNI
(LOOKS AT MARGE) How about the
beautiful American woman?
HOMER
(LEAPING UP) Don't you touch her, you


filthy terrorists! I...


They level their guns at Homer. There's a tense moment.


HOMER
(CONT'D)
(GULPS, THEN TO MARGE) You'll be fine.


They seem nice.

EXT. EXOTIC MOORISH HOUSE - A LITTLE LATER
The terrorists push Marge in the door.
MARGE
(INTRIGUED) What are you exotic men
going to do with me?
OMAR
Provide you with your life's greatest
pleasure.
DISSOLVE
TO:
INT. EXOTIC HOUSE - KITCHEN - LATER
Marge, in a tattered dress, puts a load of terrorist head
scarves in the washing machine. Then she sweeps the floor,
using the dustpan again and again, then sponging the sink
until it's spotless.
MARGE
(BORED SIGH)
BACK TO
REALITY
In the Simpson kitchen, Marge frowns.
MARGE
Maybe I should have taken that
daydreaming class at the Learning


LISA
walks through in the foreground, holding an empty can
of Duff.


LISA
Mom, Dad threw his beer can at the
Miracle Gro guy on TV. Can I recycle


it?


3F18 FINAL 1 9/22/95


MARGE
(JOYLESS) Why not.
We follow Lisa outside.
EXT. SIMPSONS' - FRONTYARD - CONTINUOUS
Just as Lisa lifts the lid off the garbage can, Bart
SKATEBOARDS
by out of her view and tosses his gum at the
can. It lands in Lisa's hair. Lisa feels her hair, then
sniffs her fingers.
LISA
(SHRIEKS) Waaa! Uhh! There's gum in
my hair!
INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
Lisa runs in frantically.
LISA
Mo-om! Someone threw gum in my hair!
MARGE
Are you sure? Maybe it's just shampoo.
(CONFIDENT) That washes right out.
LISA
No, it's somebody's gross gum! Get it
out! (PLUCKING AT IT) Ow! Ow! It's
pulling out my hairs!


Lisa tugs at the gum impatiently. Marge comes over to
examine it.


MARGE
Let me see, let me see.
LISA
(CONT'D)
I don't even chew gum! I'm the one who


got it outlawed at the airport!


Page 8.


3F18 FINAL 1 9/22/95


MARGE
Now stop, Lisa, stop it. You're just
getting it more tangled. Wait -- if I
remember my Heloise, the trick to


getting out gum is peanut butter.


She gets out a jar and spoons a dollop into Lisa's hair.


MARGE
(CONT'D)
There. Now that gum should lift right
out.
she tugs on it unsuccessfully.

MARGE
(CONT'D)
Hmmm... Maybe it needs a little
mayonnaise to get going. (GRUNTS;
DOLLOPS SOME
ON) Okay, you go sit in


the sun and let it melt in.


EXT. SIMPSON HOUSE -
CONTINUOUS


Lisa goes


outside and sits grumbling on the lawn.
LISA
Why me? (SNIFFS) Yuk! I smell like a


sandwich.


As she sits there, we hear a BUZZING in the background.
Lisa waves a bug away from her head. Suddenly
a black cloud of FLIES and BEES descends on the goop in her


Then more.


hair.


She runs blindly in circles to get away.


LISA
(CONT'D)


Gaaah!


as it BUZZES her and then loses interest and flies away.


Page 9.


We follow one bee


3F18 FINAL 1 9/22/95 Page 10.


BEE'S P.O.V. - ULTRA-VIOLET SPECTRUM - FISH-EYE LENS
The bee flies across Springfield. It stops and does a
double-take when it sees BUMBLEBEE MAN on the street
(entering Channel Ocho). Then it flies into the park and
floats above BURNS and SMITHERS, who are riding a tandem
bike. Smithers is doing all the pedaling in front, while
Burns (reading "Auto-Gyro Enthusiast") has his feet resting
against Smithers' back. The bee lands on Smithers.
NORMAL
SHOT
Smithers suddenly stops pedaling.
BURNS
Smithers, what is the meaning of this
slacking off?
SMITHERS
There's a bee in my eye, Sir.
BURNS
And?
SMITHERS
I'm allergic to bee-stings. They cause
me to, um, die.
BURNS
But we're running out of forward
momentum.
SMITHERS
Uh, perhaps you could pedal for just a
little while, sir?
BURNS
Quite impossible. I can try to bat him
off if you like.


GRUNTING, Burns waves feebly at the bee.


3P18 FINAL 1 9/22/95


SMITHERS


Really, that's oka-- Aaaggh!


Smithers is stung. His head lolls drunkenly. His legs


slip off the pedals.

BURNS
Holy cats, man, we're starting to
wobble!

SMITHERS
(THICKLY) Get me... to a hospital.
You have... to pedal.

BURNS
Allright. We'll go to a hospital, but
we'll get there the only way I know
how. (STARTS TO SHOUT) Smithers, you
infernal ninny! Stick your left hoof
on that flange now!

Smithers slowly puts his left foot on the pedal.

BURNS
(CONT'D)
Now if you can get it through your bug-
addled brain, jam that second mephitic
clod-hopper of yours on the right doo-
dad! (SMITHERS DOES) Now pump those
scrawny chicken legs, you stuporous


funker!


Page 11.


Smithers, in a zombie-like state, obeys from sheer force of


habit, and the bicycle picks up speed. Burns keeps


yelling at him desperately, the spit flying from his lips.


3F18 FINAL 1 9/22/95 Page 12.


BURNS
(CONT'D)
Pull on the gizmack! Make the
wheelygig go that-a-way!
EXT. SPRINGFIELD HOSPITAL - A FEW MINUTES LATER SCENE 3


Burns, exhausted from yelling, urges Smithers on as they
wobble up.


BURNS
(BREATHING HARD AND HOARSE) One more
jostle, you wretched shirkaday!
Burns collapses just as they reach the entrance.
PARAMEDICS
rush out, glance at both men, then bundle Mr.
Burns into a stretcher and dash back inside.
INT. SPRINGFIELD HOSPITAL -
CONTINUOUS
The paramedics hustle Mr. Burns down the hall, passing DR.
NICK
RIVIERA, walking the other way. We FOLLOW Dr. Nick
into a conference room.
INT. HOSPITAL - CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS.
Dr. Nick enters to face a stern Medical REVIEW BOARD.
DR.
NICK
Hi, everybody!

MEMBERS
(GRIM UNISON) Hi, Dr. Nick.
REVIEW BOARD
CHAIRMAN
Dr. Nick, the review board has received
a few complaints against you. Of the
160 gravest charges, the most troubling
are: performing major operations with a
knife and fork from a seafood


restaurant --

Nick runs


in (followed by the Review Board) .
DR.
NICK
(BRUSQUE) Hi, everybody. Now tell Dr.
Nick where is the trouble.
GRAMPA
I'm edgy! I got ants in my pants! I'm
discombobulated! Get me a calmative!
DR.
NICK
Slow down, sir! You're going to give


yourself skin failure.


Grampa obediently waves his scalpel more slowly.

3F18 FINAL 1 9/22/95


DR. NICK
(CONT'D)
Okay. Now, the symptoms you describe
point to "bonus eruptus." [t's a
terrible disorder where the skeleton
tries to leap out the mouth and escape
the body.

GRAMPA
(INTERESTED) Now you're talkin'.

DR.
NICK
(HAMMY) Now! Now! There's no time,


man! We'll have to improvise.


Dr. Nick RIPS the power cord out of a lamp, strips the
wires and touches them; they SPARK.
We can't see anything but a shower of SPARKS.


GRAMPA


(YELP, THEN BIG SIGH OF RELIEF)


. Nick hands the wires to the orderly.


DR.
NICK


Keep doing that every five seconds.

CHATRMAN
Dr. Nick, we owe you an apology.
Consider the charges dropped.
DR.
NICK
(CELEBRATING) All right! Free nose
jobs for everybody!
He points at JASPER, who sits nearby.
DR. NICK
(CONT'D)
Yiy! You first.
JASPER
Give me a Van Heflin.
Dr. Nick escorts Jasper into the operating room. Behind
them, the orderly treats Grampa again with more SPARKS, and
the lights flicker.
INT. MOE'S BAR -
SIMULTANEOUS


MOE
taps a flickering lamp bulb with his finger and the
flicker stops. He turms to Barney.


MOE
Say, ah, Barn. Remember when I said
I'd have to send away to NASA to
calculate your bar tab?

BARNEY
(CHUCKLES) Oh yeah, we all had a good
laugh, Moe.

MOE
(DEAD SERIOUS) The results came back
today.


He PLOPS a huge printout on the bar, which he begins to
scan.


3F18 FINAL 1 9/22/95 Page 16.


MOE
(CONT'D)
(READING) You owe me... 70 billion
dollars. (BEAT) No, wait, wait,
wait... Oh, that's for the Voyager
Space Craft. (BEAT) Your tab's 14
billion dollars.
BARNEY
Well, alls I got is two thousand bucks.
Barney takes a wad of money out of his wallet.
MOE
(CONSIDERING) Well, that's halfway
there.
Moe grabs the money, puts it in the cash register, and
CLOSES
the drawer. A big satisfied smile comes across his
face. Just then, JAILBIRD KICKS open the door. He strides
in, pulling out a revolver and aiming it at Barney.
JAILBIRD
(TO MOE) Huh. Freeze, dude. Move a
muscle and I'll blow this wino's head
off.
Moe drops down behind the bar, SCRAMBLES loudly to a back
door, opens it from the floor and runs out. We hear
FOOTSTEPS
on stairs, a DOOR SLAM SHUT, then a panel in the
back wall of the bar SCRAPES open and Moe peers into the
bar through a thick bulletproof window.
MOE
(MUFFLED) I'm callin' the cops!
JAILBIRD
Fudge.


Jailbird jumps the bar and heads toward the cash register.
Moe looks panicked.

MOR
No! Stay outta there! Stay outta


there! Aw, Good God, no!!


Page 17.


In desperation, Moe starts FLICKING a nearby light switch
up and down frantically. Various lights in the bar go on


and off. Jailbird, undeterred, opens the cash register
drawer and pulls out the wad of cash.


JAILBIRD
Hello, new speakers! Ha-ha!
He throws the money in a brown paper bag and runs out.
MOE
Come back here, you stinkin' -- (LOOKS
AROUND, A BIT CONCERNED) Hey, I wonder


how much air is in here.


Moe's eyes roll back and he drops out of frame with a THUD.

FADE
IN:
INT. SKINNER'S HOUSE - FOYER - AFTERNOON SCENE 4


The doorbell RINGS. PRINCIPAL SKINNER excitedly OPENS the
door to reveal SUPERINTENDENT CHALMERS on the porch, with a
bottle of wine.


CHALMERS
Well, Seymour, I made it -- despite
your directions.
SKINNER
Ah, Superintendent Chalmers, welcome.
I hope you're prepared for an
unforgettable luncheon.
CHALMERS
Yeah.
INT. SKINNER'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - A FEW SECONDS LATER
As Chalmers sits in the dining room, Skinner returns to the
kitchen and emits a HORRIFIED GASP when he sees a column of
smoke spewing from the oven. He opens it to reveal a
flaming roast.
SKINNER
Oh, ye Gods! My roast is ruined!


He looks out the kitchen window to see the Krustyburger
restaurant down the street.


SKINNER
(CONT'D)
(GETS AN IDEA) But what if... I were
to purchase fast food and disguise it
as my own cooking? (CHUCKLES) Ooh,
delightfully devilish, Seymour.


3F18 FINAL 1 9/22/95 Page 19.


He opens the window and starts climbing out. Just then,

Chalmers enters the kitchen and sees Skinner climbing out
the window while smoke bellows from the stove. Chalmers

looks incredulous.

FREEZE
FRAME


Over stills from their previous confrontations, we hear the
THEME MUSIC
to "Skinner & The Superintendent":


SINGERS
Ski-i-ner / With his crazy explanations
/ The Superintendent's / Gonna need his
medication / When he hears Skinner's
lame exaggerations / There'll be
trouble in town tonight!

CHALMERS

(ANGRY) Sey-mour!!

ACTION
RESUMES

SKINNER
Superintendent! I was just... eh...
stretching my calves on the windowsill!
Isometric exercise. Care to join me?

CHALMERS
Why is there smoke coming from your
oven, Seymour?

SKINNER
Ah... oh, that isn't smoke. It's
steam. Steam from the steamed clams
we're having. (RUBS STOMACH) Mmmm,


steamed clams.


3F18 FINAL 1 9/22/95 Page 20.


Chalmers shoots Skinner a skeptical glance and exits.
Skinner wipes his brow, SIGHS WITH RELIEF, climbs out the
window, and dashes off toward Krustyburger (where a police
car is parked outside.)
INT. SKDUWER'S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - TEN MINUTES LATER
Chalmers sits at the dinner table as Skinner emerges from
the kitchen with a platter of hamburgers and french fries,
removed from their wrappers.
SKINNER
Superintendent, I hope you're ready for
mouth-watering hamburgers!
CHALMERS
I thought we were having steamed clams.
SKINNER
No, no. I said "steamed hams." That's
what I call hamburgers.
CHALMERS
You call hamburgers "steamed hams?"
SKINNER
Yes. It's a regional dialect.
CHALMERS
Uh-huh. What region?
SKINNER
Uh, Upstate New York.
CHALMERS
Really. Well, I'm from Utica and I've
never heard anyone use the phrase


"steamed hams."


3F18 FINAL 1 9/22/95


SKINNER
Oh, not in Utica, no. It's an Albany
expression.
CHALMERS
I see.
FIFTEEN MINUTES
LATER
Skinner and Chalmers are drinking wine and eating the
hamburgers. Chalmers lifts the bun off his and examines
the pickles, mustard, etc.
CHALMERS
Y'know, these hamburgers are quite
similar to the ones they have at
Krustyburger.
SKINNER
(CHUCKLES) Oh, no. Patented
Skinnerburgers. Old family recipe.
CHALMERS
For "steamed hams."
SKINNER
Yes.
CHALMERS
Yes. And you call them steamed hams
despite the fact they are obviously
grilled?


Skinner notices smoke curling up from under the kitchen
door.

SKINNER
(DABBING MOUTH WITH NAPKIN) Y... you
know... one thing I sho... Excuse me
for one second.
CHALMERS
Of course.
He gets up, goes into the kitchen, and immediately returns.
Through the swinging door, we get a glimpse of the raging
fire within, which illuminates the entire kitchen.
SKINNER
(CONT'D)
(FAKE YAWN & STRETCH) Ahh. Well, that
was wonderful. A good time was had by
all. I'm pooped.
CHALMERS
(LOOKS AT WATCH) Yes, I should be --
(SEES INTO KITCHEN) Good Lord! What
is happening in there?
SKINNER
Aurora borealis.
CHALMERS
Aurora borealis?! At this time of
year? At this time of day? In this
part of the country? Localized
entirely within your kitchen?
SKINNER
Yes.


CHALMERS


(INTERESTED) May I see it?


3F18 FINAL 1 9/22/95 Page 23.


SKINNER
No.
EXT. SKINNER'S HOUSE - FRONT PORCH - THIRTY SECONDS LATER
Skinner escorts Chalmers outside.
SKINNER'S MOM
(0.S.)
Seymour, the house is on fire!
SKINNER
(CALLING) No, Mother, it's just the
Northern Lights.
CHALMERS
Well, Seymour, you are an odd fellow,
but I must say -- you "steam a good
ham."


As Chalmers leaves down the walkway, flames can be seen
within every first floor window.


SKINNER'S MOM
(0.S.)
Help! Help!
Chalmers turns. Skinner smiles and gives him a big
thumbs-up. Chalmers finally disappears, and Skinner races
back into the house. The WAIL OF SIRENS is heard.
EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS SCENE 5
Homer walks down the street, holding MAGGIE in one arm, a
bag of groceries in the other, and SANTA'S LITTLE HELPER'S
leash wrapped around his wrist. A fire engine ZOOMS by, on
its way to Skinner's house. As Homer passes a row of
newspaper boxes, the headline of the Springfield Shopper
catches his eye.
HOMER
(READING) "Helms Calls for Donut Tax?!"


(WORRIED GASP)


3F18 FINAL 1 9/22/95 Page 24.


Juggling Maggie and the grocery bags, he DROPS in some
coins and opens the box. Maggie SUCKS loudly and the dog
BARKS
as Homer shifts them around, trying to find a free
hand to grab the paper. Finally, he snatches it and the
door SNAPS closed.
HOMER
(CONT'D)
There. Done and done.
He notices that he's now carrying the STILL-BARKING dog,
the groceries are on the ground and Maggie's locked in the
newspaper box. He RATTLES the handle desperately, but the
door only opens a crack. He checks his pockets for more
change but only finds several oddly elongated, paper thin
quarters.
HOMER
(CONT'D)
(GROANS) Oh, why did I have to stop at
the railroad tracks? Better get some
change.
He starts to walk away.
MAGGIE
(CRYING) Dah!
Homer hurriedly returns.
HOMER
It's okay. It's okay. I'm back. See,
Daddy's here.


GRUNTING, he sticks his finger through the crack and
strokes Maggie.


HOMER
(CONT'D)
C'mon, Maggie, maybe if you just
squeeze a little...


Homer hooks a finger in her baby outfit and pulls a corner
through the crack.


HOMER
(CONT'D)


That's it, that's it, I...


3F18 FINAL 1 9/22/95 Page 25.


With a RIP, Homer pulls her whole outfit through the door,
leaving her naked inside the box.


HOMER

MAGGIE

Maggie grabs the edge of the top newspaper and rolls it
over her like a blanket, exposing a headline which reads
"DEADBEAT DAD BEAT DEAD."
MAUDE FLANDERS
(0.S.)
Uh, can we get a paper?
HOMER
(SCREAMS)
He turns to see MAUDE FLANDERS and HELEN LOVEJOY staring at
him. Homer jumps in front of the box, blocking their view
of Maggie.
HOMER
(CONT'D)
Ah, all out. How 'bout a Wall Street
Journal? I enjoy their no-nonsense
editorials.
HELEN
(DISDAINFUL) That's a New York paper,
if you know what I mean.
HOMER
(GETTING BIG IDBA) Wait -- I'll sell
you my paper. (HANDS HELEN PAPER)
Thirty-five cents.
MAUDE
(HESITANT) Well... Um, all right.


Maude quickly writes a check.

They take the paper and leave.

Okay. Okay. Think, Homer...
SANTA'S LITTLE
HELPER

HOMER
The dog!
The dog perks up quizzically. Homer TEARS off a piece of
the grocery bag, pulls out an aerosol can of "Cheesy Does
It!" and uses it to write a note, MUTTERING as he does.
CLOSE-UP ON
NOTE


It reads "ASK ME ABOUT MY TRAPPED BABY." He tucks it into
the dog's collar and unhooks the leash.


HOMER
(CONT'D)
(TO DOG) Okay! Go, boy! Go find
help! Go find help, boy!


The dog runs a yard away, then shakes the note out of his
collar and licks off the cheese.


HOMER
(CONT'D)
Oh, bad dog! Bad dog!

We hear the SOUNDS OF MAGGIE PLAYING and Homer COOING to
her. The CAMERA SLOWLY moves down the hall into her
room...
INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - MAGGIE'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS
We see Homer watches over her as she plays peacefully in
her playpen still trapped inside the now-uprooted newspaper
box. She picks up the newspaper and starts playing peek-a-
boo with Homer and GIGGLING. Each time Maggie holds the
paper up to her face, we see a coupon for a Krustyburger.
ZOOM IN

INT. KRUSTYBURGER - DAY - CONTINUOUS
A Krustyburger moves up and down in CHIEF WIGGUM'S hand as
he eats it. Wiggum, EDDIE and LOU sit in an orange-ish
vinyl booth, a la "Pulp Fiction," eating lunch.
LOU
You know, I went to the McDonald's in,
uh, Shelbyville on Friday night.
WIGGUM
The McWhat?
LOU
Uh, McDonald's Restaurant. I... I
never heard of it either, but they have

You know the funniest thing, though?


It's the little differences.

LOU
Well, in McDonald's you can buy a
Krustyburger with Cheese, right?, but


they don't call it a Krustyburger with


Cheese.
WIGGUM

Get out--! What do they call it?
Lou


Quarter Pounder with Cheese.
WIGGUM
(SHAKING HEAD) "Quarter Pounder with
Cheese." Well, I can picture the
cheese... But, uh, do they have Krusty
Partially-Gelatinated Non-Dairy Gum-
Based Beverages?
LOU
Mmm-hmm. They call 'em "shakes."
EDDIE
(SNORT) Heh. "Shakes." You don't

We see that Wiggum's swollen gut has him firmly wedged into
the booth. Lou takes a fork and jabs Wiggum's seat cushion
and seat-back, causing them to DEFLATE and free Wiggum.
From outside, they hear CHEERFUL MEXICAN MUSIC.


EXT. SPRINGFIELD STREET - SIMULTANEOUS SCENE 6
A tired BUMBLEBEE MAN drives by in his Toyota Camry
listening to the RADIO. We follow him home to his average
suburban house.
INT. BUMBLEBEE MAN'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
Bumblebee Man comes into the kitchen, KISSES his WIFE
hello, and takes off his costume (revealing himself to be a
very average-looking guy underneath). His little CHIHUAHUA
BARKS
cheerfully. We see action in thought balloons as he
narrates:
BUMBLEBEE
MAN
Ai, que dia miserable a trabajo!
THOUGHT
BALLOONS
BUMBLEBEE MAN
(V.0.)
Primero, una catastrofia con una pelota
de beisbol!
Bumblebee Man is dressed in an old-timey baseball uniform
(a la Babe Ruth). From offscreen, we hear the CRACK of a
crisp line-drive. As the ball WHISTLES nearer, he holds
out his glove cockily. A Bumblebee-Man sized baseball
SMACKS
into him and carries him off-screen.
BUMBLEBEE MAN
(V.0. CONT'D)
Luego, un disastro de electricidad!
Bumblebee Man (with a big napkin tied around his neck) is
eating a plate of spaghetti. As he's eating, a GROWN MAN
in a little boy's sailor suit puts the other end of his
spaghetti noodle in an electric socket. With a SIZZLE, an
arc of blue electricity SHOOTS along the noodle and across
Bumblebee Man's antennae.
BUMBLEBEE MAN

BACK TO
REALITY
BUMBLEBEE
MAN
(STRETCHING AND YAWNING) Ahh, tiempo
para relaxar en paz y quieto
His wife leaves the room. Bumblebee Man, looking for a
snack, walks over to a cupboard and opens it. The cupboard
is filled with oranges, which RAIN DOWN on his head.
BUMBLEBEE MAN
(CONT'D)
Ai, naranjas en la cabeza!
Dazed, he staggers away, trips over the chihuahua, which
YIPS, and BUMPS into the radio, which turns on and starts
playing loud, FRANTIC MEXICAN MUSIC. He stumbles backward
and falls on a wall-mounted ironing board, which catapults
him into the air. He GRABS the chandelier and dangles
there for a beat.
BUMBLEBEE MAN
(CONT'D)
Ai, una candelabra precariosa!
The chandelier LURCHES four inches downward. After a beat,
it FALLS TO THE FLOOR on top of Bumblebee Man, bringing the
entire ceiling with it. Then, one by one, the four walls
fall over.
BUMBLEBEE MAN
(CONT'D)
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! (etc.)
Bumblebee Man sits in the rubble, the dog YIPPING and
running in circles around him. His wife comes down the
still-intact staircase to see their non-existent kitchen
and starts SCREAMING.
BUMBLEBEE MAN'S
WIFE

INCREDIBLY LOUD DISTORTED ROCK MUSIC blares on Jailbird's

Wiggum crosses the street in front of him, holding a box of
donuts.


CHIEF
WIGGUM
(OBLIVIOUS, TO THE TUNE OF "I GOT
RHYTHM") I got donuts / I got donuts /
I --
(NOTICES JAILBIRD, FRIENDLY) Hey,
I know you!
A panicky Jailbird steps on the gas and KNOCKS Wiggum down.
His car PLOWS into a mailbox, KNOCKING it over and
releasing a GEYSER of letters and packages shooting into
the air. Kids run up and FROLIC in the geyser. Jailbird
jumps out of his damaged car and starts running away.
Wiggum limps after him.
JAILBIRD
Ooh! Haw-haw!
CHIEF WIGGUM
(CONT'D)
Hey, wait up! We gotta swap insurance
info!
He catches up to Jailbird, who turns and punches him in the


face. They get in a NOISY FIGHT, and go rolling down the
street, and into an open doorway.

smashed open on the street. One of the donuts rolls into a
sewer grate.

CONTINUOUS
The donut falls into a rushing stream and is carried away.
EXT. EVERGREEN TERRACE - DAY - CONTINUOUS
Reverend Lovejoy's big SHEEPDOG SNIFFS, SCRATCHES and
WHIMPERS
at the sewer grate. REV. LOVEJOY yanks the dog
away and drags him down the street. After a few steps, he
slows and looks around nervously.
REV.
LOVEJOY
Come on, boy. This is the spot --
right here. That's a good boy. Good
boy. Do your dirty, sinful business.


We see that Lovejoy and his dog have stopped on the front
lawn of a house. The door opens. NED FLANDERS comes out.


FLANDERS
Howdy, Reverend Lovejoy. Nice to see
you there (FADING ENTHUSIASM) ... on my

Oh, uh, uh, ooh... bad dog. Look at
that. Right on Ned's lawn. Now how
could you do such a thing?
(WHISPERING) Good boy, don't stop now.
(LOUDLY) Bad dog! I condemn you to
hell!

FLANDERS
Better get my cotton work gloves back
from Homer, huh?


Ned walks over to the Simpson house and looks in the
kitchen window.


INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - KITCHEN - SECONDS LATER
Ned sticks his head in through the open window to see Marge
squeezing half a grapefruit on Lisa's spikes, like a
juicer. Her head is coated in gunk.
FLANDERS
Marge Simpson -- still making juice the
old-fashioned way?
LISA
No, I've got gum in my hair!
MARGE
Oh, we've tried everything. Olive oil,

Marge holds Lisa's head on the table as Flanders POUNDS her
hair with a hammer. A bowl of nearby ice cubes RATTLES
with each blow.

Ah! Ah! Ah! Stop! Stop!
Flanders stops and they feel the gum.
FLANDERS
Hmm. (FEELING GUM) I seem to have
mashed more hair into it. Oh well.

No, you may not. The bathroom is for

Milhouse hands the Comic Book Guy some change. As he hands
Milhouse the comic, MR. VAN HOUTEN enters the store.
(Through the open door we see MRS. VAN HOUTEN waiting
patiently in the car.)
MR. VAN

Nelson takes off down the street, running for his life. As
he passes Mrs. Glick, she trips him with her cart, allowing
the man to gain on him. Nelson scrambles up and runs
around the corner. The man turns the corner, finding only
Lisa. She points to a manhole.

LISA
He's down there.
NELSON
(0.S.)
(DESPERATE, ECHOEY) Crud!
The man reaches in and pulls Nelson out by palming his
head. He sets Nelson down and kneels to give him a stern
lecture.
VERY TALL
MAN
(SLOW DEEP VOICE, IRATE:) Do you find
something comical about my appearance
when I am driving my automobile?
NELSON
Yeah.
VERY TALL
MAN
Everyone needs to drive a vehicle, even
the very tall. This was the largest
auto that I could afford. Should I
therefore be made the subject of fun?
NELSON
I guess so.
VERY TALL
MAN
(SOUNDS OF FRUSTRATION; REALLY STEAMED)
Would you like it if I laughed at your
misfortune? Huh?! Maybe we should
find out.


He yanks Nelson's pants down around his ankles, leaving him
in his underwear.


VERY TALL MAN
(CONT'D)


Now march!

The tall man gets back in his car and drives slowly behind
Nelson as he waddles awkwardly down the street. The man
HONKS
his horn repeatedly.
VERY TALL MAN
(CONT'D)
(SHOUTING) Hey, everybody, look at
this! It's that boy who laughs at
everyone! Let's laugh at him!


Lining the street is a CROWD of Springfield's biggest
losers. They all LAUGH at Nelson.


CROWD
Haw haw!
VERY TALL
MAN
(TO NELSON) Wave to the people!
Nelson waves.
VERY TALL MAN
(CONT'D)
Blow them kisses!
Nelson blows them kisses.
NELSON
(SADLY, A LA "HAW HAW") Wah wah!
Nelson is suddenly hit with streams of ketchup and mustard
from above. He squints up at Bart and Milhouse, who are on
the overpass above the road, and shakes his fist.
EXT. OVERPASS -
CONTINUCUS
BART
/ MILHOUSE
(GLEEFUL LAUGHTER)
BART
Well, Milhouse, I guess interesting
stuff does happen to people in


Springfield.


Page 47.


They get down from the overpass and walk back towards the
Kwik-E-Mart.


MILHOUSE
Yep, everybody in town's got their
story to tell.
BART
There's just not enough time to hear
‘em all...
As Bart and Milhouse disappear into the Kwik-E-Mart, PROF.
FRINK
frantically dashes onscreen, PANTING, and carrying an
ART CARD
which reads "The Tomfoolery of Professor John
Frink." He turns to camera.
FRINK
(OUT OF BREATH) Oh, sorry I'm late.
There was trouble at the lab, with the
running and the exploding and the
crying. One of the monkeys stole the
glasses off my head.
We begin a SLOW FADE OUT.
FRINK
(CONT'D)
(PLEADING) No, wait, please, no!
Please! I have a funny story -- if you
listen -- I even wrote theme music!


Yeah, listen!

BLACK
FRINK
(CONT'D)
(CLEARS THROAT, THEN; SINGING) Hey,
hey / Professor Frink / Professor Frink
/ He'll make you laugh / He'll make you
think / He likes to run and then the
thing with the... person -- (GIVES UP)
(SAD FRINK SIGH) Ah, boy, that
monkey's gonna pay...
THE
END

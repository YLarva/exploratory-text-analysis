IN:
INT. TELEVISION STUDIO - KRUSTY'S CIRCUS RING
We hear CIRCUS MUSIC. A spotlight hits a small clown car
which is driving into the ring. KRUSTY THE CLOWN hops out.
There is a bleacher full of young CHILDREN, who CHEER
wildly.
KRUSTY
Hey, kids! Who do you love?
CHILDREN
Krusty!
KRUSTY
How much do you love me?
INT. SIMPSON LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS


Bart, Lisa and Maggie are sitting on the couch, watching
Krusty on TV.


BART/LISA/CHILDREN
With all our hearts!
KRUSTY

What would you do if I went off the
air?
BART/LISA/ CHILDREN
We'd kill ourselves!

SIDESHOW
BOB
(BLOWS SLIDE WHISTLE UP AND DOWN)
KRUSTY
(HAS UNDERSTOOD WHISTLE) What's that,
Sideshow Bob? This is Brittany and
today's her birthday?
SIDESHOW
BOB
(BLOWS HIS WHISTLE UP)
KRUSTY
Well, happy birthday, Brittany. How do
you want to celebrate? Do you want me
to sing you a birthday song?
SIDESHOW
BOB
(BLOWS HIS WHISTLE ENTHUSIASTICALLY)
KRUSTY
Or do you want me to shoot Sideshow Bob
out of a cannon? (LAUGHS)
SIDESHOW
BOB

her special birthday wish.
BACK TO
BART
BART
(LAUGHING) You're doomed, Sideshow Bob.
BACK TO
STUDIO


Krusty, Sideshow Bob and Brittany are standing by a large
cannon. The cannon is aimed at a safety net in the b.g.


KRUSTY
I know we haven't had much luck
shooting you out of this cannon, but
maybe that's because we haven't used
enough gun powder!


Krusty picks up a big can labeled GUN POWDER and pours it
liberally into the cannon.


KRUSTY

You think that's enough, Sideshow Bob?
SIDESHOW
BOB

(BLOWS HIS WHISTLE ENTHUSIASTICALLY)


Sideshow Bob climbs into the cannon. Krusty tamps Bob down
with a big plunger.


KRUSTY
You comfy in there, Sideshow Bob?
SIDESHOW BOB

Krusty hands Brittany an oversized sparkler. He picks her
up and allows her to light the fuse.


BACK TO BART AND
LISA
They look on with expressions of gleeful anticipation.
Brittany lights the fuse. There is an EXPLOSION, a huge
puff of smoke and Sideshow Bob drops out of the mouth of
the cannon.
SIDESHOW BOB
(0.S.)
(WEAK ECHOING SLIDE WHISTLE)
Sideshow Bob crawls out of the cannon. He is sooty and
smoky from head to foot. His grass skirt has been replaced
by oversized polka-dotted boxer shorts. He sits dazed for
a moment, then collapses.
KRUSTY
(LAUGH) Don't blame me --
Krusty turns to the camera.
KRUSTY/BART/LISA/CHILDREN
I didn't do it!
Everyone LAUGHS.
BART
Comedy, thy name is Krusty.
KRUSTY
Hey, kids. It's time for Itchy and
Scratchy. (CHILDREN CHEER)
The ITCHY AND SCRATCHY theme MUSIC comes on.
ITCHY AND SCRATCHY
CHORUS
"They fight, they bite/they bite and
fight and bite/bite, bite, bite/fight,
fight, fight/The Itchy and Scratchy


Show."


FINAL DELIVERY
10/25/89 PAGE 5.


We hear some idyllic MUSIC: The opening of the William
Tell Overture. Scratchy is asleep in a hammock. PAN to
Itchy, who is holding a flaming arrow. He fires it and
hits Scratchy in the butt. Scratchy starts to run around
as the flames rapidly engulf him. We CUT TO Itchy who is
CHUCKLING
while pouring gasoline into a bucket marked
WATER.

INT. SIMPSON LIVING

Marge has entered. Bart and Lisa are LAUGHING at the
cartoon.


CLOSE-UP -
MARGE
She watches the cartoon, appalled.
CUT
WIDE
MARGE
All this senseless violence. I don't
understand its appeal.
BART
We don't expect you to, Mon.
LISA
If cartoons were meant for adults,
they'd put them on in prime time.
Marge picks up the telephone and dials.
EXT. NUCLEAR POWER PLANT - ESTABLISHING - DAY
INT. NUCLEAR POWER PLANT - DAY
There's a red wall-phone. A light is flashing and a siren
is BLARING. Homer is eating a donut. He goes to the phone
and picks it up.
HOMER

MARGE
(INTO PHONE)
Hello, Homie. I was hoping you could
pick up a half gallon of premium ice
cream on your way home from work.

HOMER
(INTO PHONE)
Oooh, premium -- wait a minute. Why?
MARGE
(INTO PHONE)
Patty and Selma are coming over to show
us slides from their trip to the
Yucatan.
HOMER

Hello?
SELMA

Yoo hoo! Anybody home?
MARGE
(INTO PHONE)
I've got to go, Homer. My sisters are
here.
Marge hangs up the phone.
NEW
ANGLE


Patty and Selma enter the living room. They each have a
stack of four slide carousels in their arms.


MARGE
Oh, eight carousels. We're in fora
real treat!


Bart and Lisa look agog.

INT. KWIK-E-MART - EARLY
EVENING
The only people in the store are APU, the storekeeper, and
Krusty the Clown, who is in full make-up and costume and
wearing a small black robber's mask over his eyes. Krusty
is putting a burrito in the microwave oven. Homer enters
and crosses to the freezer case.
APU
(TO HOMER) Hello, steady customer.
How are you this evening, sir?
HOMER
How you doin', Apu?
The microwave bell RINGS. Krusty removes the steaming
burrito and, munching it, crosses to the magazine counter.
Homer slides open the top of the ice cream freezer and
peers in with delight.
HOMER
(TO HIMSELF) Mmm, chocolate... oooh,
double chocolate... (GASPS) New flavor!
Triple chocolate!
He lifts the ice cream out with a GRUNT.
HOMER
(CONT'D)
(TO HIMSELF) Perhaps a little
something for the trip back to the cash
register.
He reaches back in and takes out an ice cream bar. During
the above exchange, Krusty has picked up a copy of the
Springfield Review of Books. He reads it and CHUCKLES.


Homer crosses back to the counter with the gallon of ice
cream, an opened ice cream sandwich, and the ice cream bar.


FINAL DELIVERY
10/25/89 PAGE 8.


APU
What's the matter, sir? Never have I
seen you look so unhappy while
purchasing such a large quantity of ice
cream.
HOMER
The reason I look unhappy is that
tonight I have to see a slide show
starring my wife's sisters -- or as I
call them, "the gruesome twosome."
(CHUCKLES )
Krusty puts the magazine in his pocket and crosses to the
counter. He is standing directly behind Homer. He takes
out a gun. Apu is giving Homer his change from the ice
cream. Homer steps back to exit and steps on Krusty's toe.
Krusty starts jumping up and down on one foot.
KRUSTY
Ow, my foot, you lousy, stupid,
clumsy....
HOMER
(TURNING AROUND) Sorry, pal...
Homer sees the gun.
HOMER
(CONT'D)
(GASPS)


Homer SCREAMS and dives out of sight behind a chips
display.


KRUSTY
Hand over all your money in a paper


bag.


FINAL DELIVERY
10/25/89 PAGE 9.


APU
Yes, Yes, I know the procedure for
armed robbery. I do work ina
convenience store, you know.


Apu hands over the money. Krusty makes a hasty retreat
from the store. Apu addresses Homer, who is still hiding.


APU
(CONT'D)
You can emerge now from my chips. The
opportunity to prove yourself a hero is
long gone.


Homer SIGHS with relief and comes out from behind the
chips.


INT. SIMPSON LIVING ROOM
= NIGHT
Everyone is gathered around the television. Marge sits on
the couch next to Patty and Selma, who share the slide
projector's remote control. Bart, wearing a sombrero, Lisa
in a serape, and Maggie with a maraca, sit on the floor and
watch the slides, totally bored. We see a picture of
TWENTY MIDDLE-AGED WOMEN
posing in front of a tour bus.
SELMA
This is our tour group.
MARGE
Mmn-hmm.
Next we see Selma eating a taco.
PATTY
This is a Mexican delicacy called a
taco platter. Hmmm, delicious.


Next up is a picture of Selma lying in bed in her battleaxe
underwear and a pointy bra.


PATTY


This is Selma taking a siesta.

Aye carumba!
EXT. KWIK-E-MART -
NIGHT
A police car with lights flashing is parked in the middle
of the parking lot. Homer is talking to a POLICE SKETCH
ARTIST.
Apu steps out of the store, talking to police
officers LOU and EDDIE.
APU
(DISILLUSIONED) Oh please, the land of
opportunity, they said. If you ask ne,
the opportunity is to get a bullet
through your head.
The Police Artist draws a sketch.
HOMER
And he had a big nose.
Homer looks at the picture.
HOMER
(CONT'D)
No, bigger. And big red hair that came
out to... yeah, yeah like that.
POLICE
ARTIST
Well, it is a simple charcoal
rendering, but is this the man?


The Police Artist turns the pad around, revealing a perfect
likeness of the clown.


HOMER
Yeah. Wait a minute. I know hin.
It's the guy from TV. My kid's hero...


Cruddy... Crummy... Krusty the Clown!


FINAL DELIVERY

INT. SIMPSON LIVING
ROOM
Everyone is still on the couch. The kids are asleep.
PATTY
This is the ladies room at Chichen
Itza.
We see FOUR WEARY MEXICANS carrying her.
PATTY
And this is Selma in front of a statue
of the Mayan god of sloth.
We see a statue that looks just like Homer.
SELMA
(TO MARGE) Remind you of anyone?
MARGE
(MURMURS) I sure hope Homer's all
right.
INT. KRUSTY'S
APARTMENT
Krusty is still in his make-up and costume. Happily
HUMMING
he goes to pour himself a drink, splashing water
ever so delicately from a seltzer bottle. He sinks back in
his easy chair.
KRUSTY
Aaaaah.
Suddenly a battering ram BREAKS DOWN the front door and the
SPRINGFIELD SWAT TEAM
enters from every window. All the
cops stand in the freeze position with their guns pointing
at Krusty. POLICE CHIEF WIGGUM enters.
KRUSTY


Hey, hey. What's going on here?


FINAL DELIVERY
10/25/89 PAGE 12.


WIGGUM
Krusty the Clown, you are under arrest
for armed robbery. You have the right
to remain silent. Any thing you say
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah.

KRUSTY
What... is this a joke?

INT. SPRINGFIELD POLICE
STATION


Homer is sitting next to Police Chief Wiggum behind a two-
way mirror.


WIGGUM
Ready, Mr. Simpson?
HOMER
Yes, sir.
WIGGUM
(TO FLUNKY) Send in the clowns
The FLUNKY walks away and moments later FIVE GLUM CLOWNS
file in and take their positions. Each clown has a number
pinned to his chest. Krusty wears the number 4.
WIGGUM
(CONT'D)
So, Simpson. Which one is it?
Homer scrutinizes each one carefully and begins to LAUGH.
HOMER
(LAUGHING) Well, if the crime is
making me laugh, they're all guilty.
WIGGUM


No, which one is the robber?


FINAL DELIVERY
10/25/89 PAGE 13.


HOMER
Oh, definitely number... (STARTS
LAUGHING
AGAIN) Heh heh...
WIGGUM

HOMER
(INTIMIDATED) Four.
INT. SIMPSON LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
PATTY
And this is all the mail that awaited
us upon our return.
MARGE
Hmmm hnmn.
PATTY
And this is Selma dropping off our
vacation film to be developed.
MARGE
Hmmm hmmm.
SELMA
Thus concludes our Mexican odyssey.
MARGE
Very... thorough.


Marge flicks on the lights. The kids awake blinking. Just
then we hear the front door OPEN and Homer enters.


HOMER
I'm home everybody.
PATTY


Oh, goody gumdrops.

SELMA
You missed the whole slide show, Homer.
HOMER
Oh fantastic. (THEN) Marge, you're
never gonna believe what happened. I
was down at the Kwik-E-Mart minding my
own business... (HE LOOKS AT HIS WATCH)
Oooh oooh, the news.


Homer rushes to the TV and turns on the news. News THEME
MUSIC
is heard from the television set.


ANNOUNCER

CHRISTIAN
Good evening. I'm Scott Christian.
Kent Brockman is off tonight. Why did
the clown cross the road?
HOMER
Whooo -- here it is.

BART
Oh, you mean Krusty the Clown?

HOMER
He's sort of a hero of yours, isn't he?

BART
Are you kidding? He's my idol. I've
based my whole life on Krusty's
teachings.

HOMER
Well, uh... then maybe you better run
off to bed...

Earlier this evening, the Springfield
Swat Team apprehended the TV clown, who
appears on a rival station opposite our
own Emmy award-winning Hobo Hank.
We see footage of a battering ram SMASHING into the
exterior of Krusty's house. The Swat Team is swarming over
the house. Moments later, Krusty emerges, handcuffed
behind his back and looking dour, accompanied by Police
Chief Wiggum.
SCOTT CHRISTIAN

And just in... actual footage of the
crime taken with the Kwik-E-Mart
security camera.
We see black-and-white tape of the crime.

KRUSTY
Hand over all your money in a paper

BART
Oh... oh! Krusty, how could you?
Marge takes Bart to her bosom to comfort.
MARGE
Oh, Bart. I know it looks very bad,
honey -- but Krusty will get his day
in court and... who knows? Maybe it'll
turn out he was innocent all along.
HOMER
Earth to Marge. Earth to Marge. I was

INT. BART'S ROOM -
DAY
A depressed Bart is sitting in his Krusty the clown pajamas
looking at his Krusty doll. A framed eight-by-ten picture

We see the smiling face of Krusty, on which jail door bars

KRUSTY GETS BUSTED.
Then the subtitle: THE DAY THE
LAUGHTER DIED.
The graphic becomes a mortise over the
shoulder of newsman KENT BROCKMAN, who addresses the
camera.
KENT
BROCKMAN

Good evening again, Springfield.

Krusty the Clown, the beloved idol of

countless tots, now nothing more than a

common alleged criminal. His trial,

which begins tomorrow, has taken center

ring in a national media circus as

children of all ages, from eight to

eighty, hang on each new development

like so many Rumanian trapeze artists.
During above speech, the covers of the following
publications appear in the background including: Timely
Magazine with a demonic picture of Krusty. The headline
reads: KROOK OF THE YEAR. Newsweekly with cover picture
of Krusty. Headline reads: RHYMES WITH DASTARD. Today's
Guns with a picture of Apu on cover, brandishing a huge
handgun. Headline reads: .357 MAGNUM -- THE CLOWNSTOPPER;
"NEXT TIME I'LL BE READY FOR YOU, MR. CLOWN-MAN."

KENT
BROCKMAN
From his humble beginnings as a street


mime in Tupelo, Mississippi...


FINAL DELIVERY
10/25/89 PAGE 21.


In the B.G. we see a black-and-white snapshot of a street
mime being ignored by old-timers sitting in front of a
general store.
KENT BROCKMAN
(CONT'D)
Krusty clowned his way to the top of a
personal mini-empire --


In B.G. we see Krusty coffee mugs, T-shirts, calendars,
sleepwear, etc.


KENT BROCKMAN
(CONT'D)
-- with dozens of endorsements,
including his own line of pork
products. This may have led to one of
television's best-loved bloopers --
Krusty's near fatal on-the-air heart
attack in 1986.


Some labeled "File Footage" shows Krusty addressing camera.
Kids are CHEERING.


KRUSTY
Wasn't that a great Itchy and Scratchy
cartoon, kids? Well, we've got another
one coming right up, but first I got a
hankering for some pork products.
CAMERA PANS
as Krusty steps behind a little kitchen counter
where Sideshow Bob, wearing a chef's hat, is preparing
various pork products. In background are packages of
KRUSTY
brand meats.
KRUSTY
Mmmm. Look! Plump succulent sausage,


honey-smoked bacon and glistening,


sizzling...(GASPING SOUND)

Krusty begins to have a heart attack. He grabs his chest,
falls to the floor and starts rolling around. The kids
LAUGH
and CHEER at his antics. The footage ends and we go
back to the stone-faced announcer. b.g. shows photo of
Krusty's operation.
KENT
BROCKMAN

But a quick triple bypass and a

pacemaker later, Krusty bounced back.

However, he was a changed clown. Where

his show had been condemned by parents

and educators alike as simple-minded TV

mayhen...


In B.G. we see various shots of simple-minded TV mayhem,
all of it directed against Sideshow Bob.


KENT BROCKMAN
(CONT'D)
This new Krusty devoted a small portion
of every show to stamping out
illiteracy in today's anything-for-a-
thrill youth.
We see Krusty holding "Catcher In The Rye" upside-down.
Sideshow Bob is standing alongside with a bucket labeled:
Bucket o' books.
KRUSTY
Give a hoot! Read a book!
KENT BROCKMAN
(CONT'D)
Krusty's arrest has sent shock waves
through Springfield, packing its
churches, synagogues and mosques with
disillusioned citizenry from all walks


of life.


We see REVEREND LOVEJOY addressing his congregation.


FINAL DELIVERY

REV.
LOVEJOY
I urge every halfway decent member of
our community to gather up all
merchandise that bears the likeness of
Krusty, that clown prince of
corruption, and join me in a public
burning.


We see Bart in church, looking extremely shocked. Marge
comforts hin.


KENT
BROCKMAN

So is Krusty the Clown about to trade

in his baggy pants for the relatively

snug uniform of Springfield

Penitentiary? We'll find out tomorrow

when his trial begins.
In B.G. a mortise of a bowed Krusty expands to fill the
screen. He is in prison clothes, without make-up, although
his hair style is very similar and his nose is still quite


rosy and bulbous.

come on Dad, you gotta listen to me.
Homer gets up and, with Bart still locked on his arm, EXITS

towards the witness stand. A few moments later a


Bailiff returns, carrying Bart by the collar, and drops him
back in his seat.

INT. COURTROOM - CLOSE ON TV MONITOR
We see the video replay of the robbery up to the point
where Homer dives behind the chips display. We PULL OUT to
reveal the courtroom spectators, LAUGHING at Homer's
cowardice.
HOMER

DISTRICT
ATTORNEY
Was that you taking that cowardly dive
into that display of heavily-salted
snack treats?
HOMER
Yes, sir.
DISTRICT
ATTORNEY
Hmmm hmmm. Do you recognize the gunman
in this courtroom today?
HOMER
Yes, I do.
DISTRICT
ATTORNEY
Fine, would you point him out to us?
HOMER
Okay.
He raises his hand and begins to point.

BART
Oh, man.
DISTRICT
ATTORNEY
Let the record show that the witness
eventually pointed to Krusty the Clown.
The crowd MURMURS.
INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - LISA'S BEDROOM
Marge is piling Lisa's Krusty merchandise (posters, toys,
dolls, pens, balls, cups, etc.) into a paper bag. Maggie
is watching.
MARGE
These toys are just adorable. Who'd
have guessed they were inspired by an
insane criminal genius?
CLOSE UP ON

Marge pulls the pacifier from her mouth. WE SEE it has a
Krusty the Clown logo on it.

HOMER
No, I'm not. I'm hopping on the
bandwagon. Now come on, son, get with
the winning tean.
EXT. SPRINGFIELD HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL FIELD - SUNSET
We see a scoreboard sign that says "Go Springfield High
School Neutrons." Hundreds of people are gathered for the
burning. An enormous mountain of Krusty material is in the
center of the field. One by one townspeople, including the
Simpsons, throw their stuff on the pile.
MERCHANT
Hey, right here. Krusty souvenirs.
Buy ‘em and burn 'em right here.
HOMER
Look, Bart. Everyone in town is here.
Now come on, isn't it good to see
Springfield so united?
There is a concession stand filled with Krusty merchandise.


The Simpsons dump their loads into the pile just as
Reverend Lovejoy steps up to it. The sky is very dark.

REV.
LOVEJOY
Good people, I'm so happy you're all
here tonight. But please, just a few
words of caution. Now, we're going to
set this pile of evil ablaze, but
because these are children's toys the
fire will spread quickly, so please
stand back and try not to inhale the
toxic fumes.


Reverend Lovejoy lights a match and tosses it on the pile.
It immediately catches on fire.


CROWD
(IN AWE) Oooh!
WE BEGIN SERIES OF CLOSE UPS
of various townspeople, including DR. MARVIN MONROE,
MONTGOMERY
BURNS, SMITHERS, MOE, and MRS. KRABAPPEL. Their
faces, bathed in the glow of the bonfire, have mesmerized,
gleeful expressions.
CLOSE

too. His expression is one of abject horror. After a BEAT
his expression changes to one of grim determination.

The District Attorney gestures to a table where evidence is
displayed, including a stack of photos from the
surveillance camera, a stack of betting sheets, and a
plaster cast of a huge shoeprint. They are labeled A, B,

KRUSTY

DISTRICT
ATTORNEY
The one with the big B on it.
KRUSTY
(PITIFULLY) Uh... uh...
DISTRICT
ATTORNEY
What's the matter, can't you read?
KRUSTY
(BREAKING DOWN INTO TEARS) No, I
ean't! I can't read or write! I admit
it! I'm totally illiterate! Now are
you happy?
A shock wave of MURMURING goes through the court.
JUDGE
(TO KRUSTY) Can it be that the
champion of child literacy can't even
read himself?
KRUSTY
Is it a crime to be illiterate?


District attorney holds up Exhibit B.


FINAL DELIVERY
10/25/89 PAGE 31.


DISTRICT

All right, all right. See this,
Krusty? This is a 'B'. And this is
Exhibit B. Betting slips, obtained by
this court indicating that you have
lost substantial sums of money on


sports gambling --


There is appalled GASP from the crowd.

Yes, it is.

SIDESHOW

My young friends. For years I have
been silent, save for the crude
glissandos of this primitive wind
instrument. But now destiny has thrust
me into the center ring. In the coming
weeks, you will notice some rather
sweeping changes in our progran.
Please, do not be alarmed. Itchy and

Bart enters.
BART
What the hell are you doing, Lis?
LISA
I'm watching Sideshow Bob. You know,
he's a lot less patronizing than Krusty
used to be.
BART
You backstabber, you traitor, you...
LISA
(SLAPS BART IN THE FACE) Snap out of
it, Bart. Face the facts. All those
hours we spent staring at Krusty, we
were staring at a crook.
Bart shuts off the Tv.
BART
Look, Lisa, I know Krusty's innocent.
Don't ask me why. It's just a feeling
I have, like when you're reaching for
the prize at the bottom of a box of
Frosty Krusty Flakes, You can't find
it, but you know it's there, so you
keep on groping.
LISA


Oh, Bart.

Come on, Lisa. I think I can prove
Krusty's innocent, but I need your

You do? Why?
BART
Oh, come on Lis, you know why.
LISA
No, why?
BART
(RELUCTANTLY) I'11 never forgive you
for making me say this, but... you're

Lisa points to the microwave oven.
CLOSE

should stay away from this thing."


BART
So? I don't have a pacemaker.

LISA
Come on, Bart. The tape showed that
the robber heated up a burrito.


BART


LISA
Don't you remember the get-well card we
sent to Krusty? It was after his heart
attack, when he had a pacemaker put in.
BART
Ah ha!


They cross over to the magazine rack. Deep in thought,
Lisa picks up a Springfield Review of Books.


LISA
Wait a minute. Krusty can't read.
BART
(CRACKING) Okay! okay! So the poor
guy can't read! Can't we get off his


back already?


FINAL DELIVERY
10/25/89 PAGE 36.


LISA
No! Don't you get it, Bart? How could
Krusty have been reading a magazine if
he can't read?
APU
Hey, hey. This is not a lending
library. If you're not going to buy
that thing, put it down or I'll blow
your heads off.
LISA
Bart, I'm starting to think you're
right. Krusty was framed. Did he have
any enemies?
BART
I don't know, but I know someone who
would: Krusty's best friend in the
whole world, Sideshow Bob.

Great show, Sideshow. Switchboards

Thanks, Ted. I'm glad we've finally

Mmn.. Well, perhaps we can shed some
light on your problem in a new segment
exploring pre-adolescent turmoil. I
call it "Choices."
BART
I don't think so, sir.
SIDESHOW
BOB
Bart, I'm reaching out to you.
Sideshow Bob reaches a hand out. Reluctantly Bart lets
himself be led up on the stage to a spotlit alcove with
Corbusier chairs. Sideshow Bob and Bart sit.
SIDESHOW BOB
(CONT'D)
So what's on your mind, Bart? I bet
the other children don't accept you.
BART
True, Sideshow Bob, but that doesn't
bother me. You see, my sisters and I
have been doing a little investigating,
and it looks to us like Krusty was
framed.

Kwik-E-Mart. But Krusty couldn't go
near the thing. Not with his
pacemaker.

SIDESHOW
BOB
You know Bart, as much as I love
Krusty, he was never one to take
doctors' orders too seriously.

BART
Well, maybe. But, get this, Krusty was
illiterate and the guy who robbed the
store was reading the Springfield
Review of Books.

SIDESHOW
BOB
Ah, well, Bart...


Sideshow Bob reaches into his back pocket and produces a
copy of the Springfield Review of Books.


SIDESHOW BOB
(CONT'D)
The fact is, you don't have to be able
to read to enjoy the Springfield

amusing caricatures of Gore Vidal and
Susan Sontag.
Bart looks at the pictures and CHUCKLES weakly.

Bart, (TO AUDIENCE) children, this
whole sordid affair has been a shock to
all of us, but we must get on with our
lives. Let's try to remember Krusty
not as a hardened criminal, but as that
lovable jester who honked his horn and
puttered around in his little car.

BART
(GOING ALONG) And shot you out of a
cannon.

SIDESHOW
BOB
(BITTERLY) And shot me out of a

Bart grabs a microphone.
BART
Krusty didn't rob that store. Sideshow

Bart reaches o.s. and grabs a mallet, SMACKING Sideshow Bob
on the tip of one of his shoes. Sideshow Bob reacts just
as he did in the Kwik-E-Mart.

Yes, I admit it. I hated him. His
hackneyed shenanigans robbed me of my
dignity for years. I played the

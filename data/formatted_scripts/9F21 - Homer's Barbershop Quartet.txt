clothes, a TV with a coat hanger for its antenna, etc..
PAN DOWN

his podium.

Oh boy! Free trading cards!


The boys pick up elaborate Biblical trading cards, which we
see.


MILHOUSE
Wow, Joseph of Aramathia! (FLIPS IT
OVER) Twenty-six conversions in A.D.
46!
NELSON
Whoa, a Methuselah rookie card!
FLANDERS
Well, boys, who’d have thought

At a table with toys, games and dolls.
LISA
Wow an original Malibu Stacey from
1958. (NOTICING BREASTS) Oh my.


We see a vintage girl doll. The bosoms are unnaturally
huge and pointy.


MAN AT
TABLE
(WISE GUY VOICE) Yeah. They took her
off the market after some kid put
both his eyes out.
LISA
Really, how?
MAN AT
TABLE
He tried to kiss it.
ANGLE -
HERMAN’S TABLE


At HERMAN’S table of Military Souvenirs, PRINCIPAL SKINNER
examines an "iron mask," a metal cylinder with an eye slit.


PRINCIPAL
SKINNER
"Prisoner 24601"... (CHUCKLES) Why, I
wore this for two years in a Viet
Cong internment center. Never
thought I’d see the old girl again.


He slips it on.


9F21 FINAL DELIVERY 10/30/92

PRINCIPAL
SKINNER

ANGLE
HOMER
He's at MRS. GLICK’S table, looking through a big box of
stuff labelled "ALL ITEMS $5." He picks up and rejects, in
order, an original copy of the Declaration of Independence,
a copy of Action Comics Number 1, a sheet of stamps, and a
violin.
HOMER
Junk... junk... the airplane’s upside
down... Strad-i-who-vius?...


Then he pulls out an old bucket with the bottom rusted
away.


HOMER
(CONT’D)
Hey, hey!

ANGLE - SIMPSON TABLE SCENE 3
MARGE

MARGE
Your teenage son or daughter will
think this wishbone necklace is

really "cool."

JUST STAMP THE TICKET

stupid.

MARGE

9F21 FINAL DELIVERY 10/30/92


"JUST STAMP THE TICKET MAN" walks away as Homer runs up
with his purchase.


HOMER
Hey, Marge, look what I just bought.
An old bucket!
MARGE
(MURMURS) It doesn’t have a bottom.
HOMER
(MOANS) You’re right. What was I
thinking? Worthless piece of junk.
Homer throws the bucket away. The bucket lands in the
foreground and rolls toward the camera. We see an
inscription. "THIS BUCKET PROPERTY OF ABE LINCOLN."
ANGLE - COMIC BOOK
GUY
The COMIC BOOK GUY peels the breading off a corndog and
eats it as Bart and LISA check out his table. Bart picks
up an album with the cover: "‘S Wonderful, ‘S Marvelous,
‘S Krusty" -- Krusty holding a microphone and wearing a
tux. Bart pulls out an album labelled: "Melvin and the
Squirrels" featuring three squirrels that resemble human
boys in sweaters with their initials on their sweaters.
BART
What the hell is this?
COMIC BOOK
GUY
(MOUTH FULL) Melvin and the
Squirrels. Part of the rodent


invasion of the early 60s.


He sets it on a turntable and we hear three speeded up
voices SINGING "Yankee Doodle."


SPEEDED UP
VOICES
"Stuck a feather in his cap and


called it... "

LISA
Bart, look! It’s Dad!
CLOSE-UP
= ALBUM COVER SCENE 4
It's a record called "BARBERSHOP IS HERE TO STAY!" Homer,
wearing a straw boater, is a member of the pictured
quartet.
BART
Dad, when did you record an album?
HOMER
I’m surprised you don’t remember,
son. It was only eight years ago.
BART
Dad, thanks to television, I can’t
remember what happened eight minutes
ago.
Everyone LAUGHS.
BART
(CONT’D)
No, really, I can’t. It’s a serious
problem.
Everyone LAUGHS again. Bart joins in the LAUGHTER
BART
(LAUGHING) What are we all laughing


about?


6


9F21 FINAL DELIVERY 10/30/92 7.


Everyone continues to LAUGH.
HOMER
Who cares?
HOMER
Anyway, it all happened during that
magical summer of 1985... A maturing
Joe Piscopo left "Saturday Night
Live" to conquer Hollywood... People
Express introduced a generation of
hicks to plane travel... and I was in
a barbershop quartet...

PAN
across the quartet as they SING a nifty barbershop
rendition of the old song.


HOMER
(V.O.)
Every afternoon at Moe’s, Chief
Wiggum, Principal Skinner, Apu and I
would get together and sing... and
the crowds went wild.


As they SING they are pelted with roses and women’s
panties.

BARNEY
Yoo hoo!
DISSOLVE

EXT. SWAP MEET - THE PRESENT
BART
Barbershop! That kind of music
hasn’t been popular since grandma had
hair.
HOMER
Rock ‘n’ roll had become stagnant.
"Achy Breaky Heart" was seven years

void, and that something was
barbershop...

DISSOLVE
TO:
STAGE
The quartet finishes "Coney Island Babe."
QUARTET
(SINGING) Goodbye, my Coney Island
Babe.
The audience APPLAUDS enthusiastically. The quartet

between the eyes and knocks him out. Jailbird LAUGHS.
3) CHURCH
The quartet SINGS while moving down the aisle with the
collection baskets. The PARISHIONERS are throwing in
fistfuls of money. Marge is there with little Bart and
Lisa.

ALL
Goodbye my Coney Isle/ Goodbye my

As the crowd CHEERS Homer steps up to the bar. Moe draws


him a beer. A flamboyant record producer, NIGEL,
approaches Homer.


11.


9F21 FINAL DELIVERY 10/30/92 12


NIGEL
I got very excited watching you on
that stage. I think I want to get
behind you. (INTERESTED) Hmmm...
HOMER
I’m intrigued.
NIGEL
Is there someplace where we can be
alone?
HOMER
How about the men’s room?
NIGEL
Delicious.
INT.
MOE’S TAVERN - MEN’S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
Homer and Nigel are alone.
NIGEL
Homer, I’m a theatrical agent, and I


want to represent your group.


HOMER
Really?

NIGEL
Yeah!

HOMER


We’re not the greatest singers in the


world.


9F21 FINAL DELIVERY 10/30/92


NIGEL
I know that, but you’ve got something
more important than talent. You’ve
got... it! (DISTASTE) All except that
police officer. (DISGUSTED NOISE) Too
Village People. You’1ll have to
replace him.
HOMER
But Chief Wiggum owns the pitch pipe!
NIGEL
With the money you’re going to make,
you’ll be able to buy the Pitch Pipe
Building!
He points out the window to a hundred-story building topped
by an enormous pitch pipe, which for some reason we’ve
never seen before.

9F21 FINAL DELIVERY 10/30/92 14.


APU
It is a great dishonor to my
ancestors and my God, but okay.
HOMER
Is there anything I should do
different?
NIGEL
You don’t change a thing.
Wiggum throws an arm around Homer’s shoulder.
WIGGUM
This is great. And the best part of
it is I/ll be doing it with my pals.
We’re going to the top boys...
Together.
HOMER

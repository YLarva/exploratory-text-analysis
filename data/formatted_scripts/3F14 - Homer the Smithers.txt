FADE
IN:
EXT. SPRINGFIELD DRAGSTRIP - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT
A banner reads "Nuclear Power Plant Employees Night".
EXT. SPRINGFIELD DRAGSTRIP - ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS
BURNS
and SMITHERS are at the entrance, greeting the power
plant employees and their families (including the SIMPSONS).
Burns is reading from cards Smithers is handing to him one at
a time.
BURNS
(READING) Welcome employees! (NEXT
CARD) Come in! (NEXT CARD) The whole
night's entertainment is on me -- (WAITS
FOR NEXT CARD.
THEN, PLEASED:) Monty
Burns!
EMPLOYEES
(CHEER)
INSIDE
Homer (wearing his oversized foam-rubber cowboy hat and


carrying armloads of food) and the family walk down the aisle
to their seats. Homer points at the funny cars.

HOMER
(UPROARIOUS LAUGHTER) Now I know why
they call them "funny cars." I've never
laughed so much in my life. (SERIOUSLY)
Marge, those cars have the gift of
laughter.
ANNOUNCER
(V.O.)
(THOUGH ECHOEY LOUDSPEAKER) Welcome
(welcome) (welcome) to an evening of
exciting quarter mile action (action)
(action)! Now (now) now's the time to
fuel up at our fabulous smorgasbord
{orgasbord) (orgasbord) !
ON THE
DRAGSTERS
We see cars that are sponsored by Duff Beer, Laramie
Cigarettes, Kingpin Malt Liquor, Cop-Stopper Brand Explosive
Bullets, Amalgamated Pornography, and other questionable
companies (including Fox Television) .
BART
Wow, look at that Laramie car! I can't
wait to start smoking Laramies!
LISA
When I grow up, I'm going to drink
Kingpin Brand malt liquor. (BEAT) In
moderation.
HOMER


(INTRIGUED) Hmmm... "Amalgamated."


3F14 TABLE DRAFT 7/20/95


ANNOUNCER
(V.O.)
Our first race is a benefit for
daredevil Lance Murdock (Murdock)
(Murdock), who's hospitalized with
cirrhosis of the liver (liver) (liver)!


The crowd CHEERS. Marge looks around the track as the cars
line up for the race.


MARGE
Boy, it sure would be fun to carpool in
one of those, huh, kids? (BEAT) I'd be
a real hot-rod mama, wouldn't I? Huh?
Huh?

BART
You missed the race, mama.


She looks at the track to see the cars have already ROARED
across the finish line and are deploying their parachutes.


MARGE
I wish I'd pay more attention.
INT. SPRINGFIELD DRAGSTRIP - BURNS' BOX


Burns sits in his luxury box. Smithers pours a teaspoonful
of beer from a bottle and feeds it to Burns.


BURNS:
Smithers, this beer isn't working. I
don't feel any younger or "funkier."
SMITHERS


I'll switch to the tablespoon, Sir.


By


3F14 TABLE DRAFT 7/20/95 4.


ANNOUNCER
(V.O.)
Coming up next, our feature race: The
Nuclear Power Plant Championship (plant)
(plant) .
BURNS
Ah, at last! Smithers, fetch the bi-
oculars.
Smithers holds the binoculars in front of Burns' eyes and
moves them quickly to the right to follow the race.
Unfortunately, Burns' head can't quite move fast enough to
keep up with the dragsters.
BURNS
(CONT'D)
Damnation! Tell them to go slower!
SMITHERS
Yes sir.


Smithers hurries out onto the track, flags down the
dragsters, and begins arguing with the drivers.


SMASH CUT
TO:
The dragsters begin racing again. This time they're just
creeping along at five m.p.h., jockeying back and forth for
the lead. The drivers are looking up at Burns a little
resentfully.
BURNS
(HAPPILY) Go! Go!
The dragsters start to go a little faster.
BURNS
(CONT'D)
(SEVERELY) Slow down!


They slow back down again.


3F14 TABLE DRAFT 7/20/95 Bis


EXT. SPRINGFIELD DRAGSTRIP - PARKING LOT - LATER THAT EVENING
Everyone, including the Simpsons, is leaving. Smithers loads
Burns' things (including portable radio, monogrammed seat
cushion, oxygen tank and mask, and croquet set) into the
limo's trunk. Meanwhile, Burns sits in the back seat
regarding a large foam "#1" finger with dissatisfaction.
BURNS
This novelty foam hand is ludicrously
oversized. Go swap it for a smaller
one.
SMITHERS
It is a bit ostentatious, Sir. I'll be
right back.
Smithers jogs back into the dragstrip with the foam finger.
Burns settles into his seat. Suddenly an obviously drunk
LENNY, holding what's left of a beer, sticks his head in the
window and beams at Burns.
LENNY
Hey, Burnsie! This was some swell
shindig. Thank you very much.
Burns stares at Lenny for a moment in horror, then panics.
BURNS
Smithers! What's happening?!
LENNY
(OBLIVIOUS) My family had a great time
and... and I just want to shake your


hand...


Burns tries desperately to roll up his window. Lenny presses
his face against the window, looking friendly as hell.


BURNS


Smithers! Help! Smithers!!


3F14 TABLE DRAFT 7/20/95 6.
Smithers, returning with a normal-sized foam hand, sees Lenny
trying to shake hands with Burns through the vent window.
SMITHERS
(MORTIFIED) Oh my God!
He runs back to the car, peels Lenny off Burns' windshield,
and escorts him away. Lenny turns and gives Burns the thumbs
up.
BURNS
(SHRIEK OF TERROR)
INT. BURNS' LIMO - A FEW MINUTES LATER
Smithers is driving a still-shaken Burns home.
BURNS
You should've seen the murderous glint
in his eye, Smithers. He must have been
tossing back spoonfuls of beer all
evening.
SMITHERS
I'm so sorry, Mr. Burns. This was all
my fault. I have no excuse for not
being in two places at once.
BURNS
Don't concern yourself. If things had
turned ugly I always had my mace.
WIDEN TO REVEAL
Burns is holding an actual medieval-style
mace (a club with a spiked metal ball attached by a chain).
He puts the mace back in its holder, which is mounted behind
him.
SMITHERS
Don't let me off the hook that easily.
I failed you and I'll never forgive


myself. Never! Never! Never!


3F14 TABLE DRAFT 7/20/95 Ts


Smithers BANGS his head on the steering wheel to punctuate
each "never." Burns, irritated, pushes a button to raise
the partition, gradually muffling Smithers completely. The
phone RINGS in the back of the limo, and Burns answers it.
SMITHERS
(CONT'D)
(THROUGH PHONE) Never! Never! Never!
INT. POWER PLANT - BURNS' OFFICE - NEXT DAY
Smithers, wearing a different outfit, continues on.
SMITHERS
Never! (BREAKS DOWN SOBBING)
BURNS
Smithers, when was your last vacation?
SMITHERS
(EVASIVE) Recently. Somewhat recently.
BURNS
Surely there's some way of proving or
disproving your assertion. What would
that be?
SMITHERS
My file, Sir. I'11 go get it for you.
He exits and returns with a file folder labeled "Smithers,
W." Burns opens it and flips through the documents (which
include: an outdated photo of Smithers with a bushy mustache,
a Master's Degree in Sycophancy from Stanford University, and


a dishonorable discharge from the Navy.) He finally comes
upon a page marked "Vacation History."


3F14 TABLE DRAFT 7/20/95 8.


BURNS
(CONT'D)
Hmm... I see you've visited Frambesia,
Varicella, Pertussis, Rubella, Mumps...
Whoa, whoa, whoa -- these are
vaccinations, not vacations! Smithers,
you've falsified these records!
SMITHERS
(CONFIDENTLY) No, Sir. Mumps has some
of the most beautiful castles in Wales.
(BURSTING INTO TEARS) Oh, it's no use.
I can't lie to you, Mr. Burns. I've
never taken a vacation in my life. I'm
a fraud. (WILDLY) I don't deserve to
live on your planet anymore!
Smithers knocks the jug off a nearby water cooler and jams
his head into the basin, attempting to DROWN himself. Burns
calmly pushes the spigot, quickly draining all the water.
SMITHERS
(CONT'D)
(WET GURGLY CHOKING, CHANGING TO DRY
CONFUSED
NOISES)


Smithers sheepishly extracts his head from the water cooler
to see Burns regarding him sternly.


BURNS
That settles it! I insist you take a
vacation as soon as a temporary


substitute can be found.


3F14 TABLE DRAFT 7/20/95 9.


SMITHERS


(REGAINING CONTROL OF HIMSELF) I could


use some rest. But what would you do


without me, Sir?

BURNS
Tchah! I'm not a baby who needs a
nursemaid to burp me. (BELCH) You see?
I've got everything under control. Now


don't worry, I won't even notice you're


gone.


We hear a LOW,
shuts the door.


TENSE STING
as Burns ushers Smithers out and
Smithers looks worried.


INT. POWER PLANT - SMITHERS' OFFICE - NEXT DAY


Smithers is interviewing his possible temporary replacements.
The first APPLICANT looks and sounds a little like Smithers.


APPLICANT


As you can see by my resumé, I've been


both a nuclear engineer and a butler for


over twenty years.


SMITHERS


In other words, you're completely


unqualified for this job. I don't know


why the


temp agency even sent you.


A SECOND APPLICANT
approaches. He looks like a black version


of Smithers.


2ND APPLICANT


I devote my life to charming difficult


old men


3F14 TABLE DRAFT 7/20/95 10.


SMITHERS


Hit the road.


The THIRD APPLICANT looks almost exactly like Smithers. He


enters and puts a hand on Smithers' arm.


3RD APPLICANT
You look tired, Mr. Smithers. Let me
make you a cup of ginseng tea.
SMITHERS
The last thing Mr. Burns needs or wants
is a bootlicker! Get out!
INT. POWER PLANT - SMITHERS' OFFICE - LATE AT NIGHT
Smithers sits at his computer terminal.
SMITHERS
(TO HIMSELF) I've got to finda
replacement who won't outshine me.
Perhaps if I search the employee
evaluations for the word (TYPING)
“incompetent...”
ON THE COMPUTER
SCREEN


It reads "714 Matches Found."
SMITHERS
(CONT'D)


714 names! Better be more specific.
(TYPING) "Lazy", "Clumsy", "Dimwitted",


“Monstrously Ugly".


We see the familiar Macintosh “ticking watch" icon. After a


moment, the screen again reads "714 matches found."
SMITHERS
(CONT'D)


Still the same names.


3F14 TABLE DRAFT 7/20/95 11,


He thinks for a beat, then types in one more trait.
SMITHERS
(CONT'D)
(TYPING) "Despises the elderly."
This time, the computer screen reads "706 matches found."
SMITHERS
Aw, nuts to this. I'll just go get
Homer Simpson.
INT. SIMPSON HOME - DINING ROOM - THAT NIGHT


Bart and Lisa are eating. Homer toys morosely with an
uneaten portion of lasagna.


HOMER
(WHINY MOAN) TI don't want to be
assistant to that old slave-driver.
He'll hassle me for leaving early.
He'll complain about my TV being too
loud. He has no respect for the concept
of the siesta.

LISA
Don't be nervous, Dad. Assisting Mr.
Burns could give your career a real shot
in the arm.

HOMER
This isn't the way I wanted to move up.
I wanted to backstab, step on toes,
dress provocatively.


Marge enters from the kitchen and sets a bowl of corn on the
table.

MARGE
Don't be nervous, Homer. Assisting Mr.
Burns could give your career a real shot
in the arn.
LISA
Mo-omm! I just said that!
MARGE
Sor-ry. Next time get your own darned
corn.
INT. POWER PLANT - SMITHERS' OFFICE - NEXT DAY
Homer sits uncomfortably in Smithers' chair.
HOMER
Is this the chair I'll be sitting on?
SMITHERS
Yes. Now I realize caring for Mr. Burns
seems like a big job, but actually it's
just 2800 small jobs.
HOMER
(MOAN)
SMITHERS
Your new duties will include answering
Mr. Burns' phone, preparing his tax
return, moistening his eyeballs,
assisting with his chewing and
swallowing, lying to Congress, and some
light typing.


The phone RINGS. Smithers answers it.


3F14 TABLE DRAFT 7/20/95 13.


SMITHERS
(CONT'D)
(INTO PHONE) Montgomery Burns!
office... Oh, hello Mrs. Burns... I'll
see if your son is available.
Smithers covers the mouthpiece.
HOMER
Mr. Burns has a mother!? She must be a
hundred million years old!
SMITHERS
She has limited capacities. All she can
do is dial and yell.
Smithers puts the phone to his ear.
SMITHERS
(CONT'D)
(INTO PHONE) I'm sorry, Monty can't
come to the phone right now. He's, uh,
beating back a wave of molten uranium to
save the town.


In the background, we see Burns at his desk, sitting drowsily
in the sunlight. He nods off for a second, then jerks awake.


SMITHERS
(CONT'D)
Okay, I'll give him the message. (HANGS
UP, TURNS TO HOMER) Mr. Burns doesn't
like to talk to his mother. They had a
falling-out over the 0.J. Trial.
INT. POWER PLANT - BURNS' OFFICE - A FEW MINUTES LATER


Smithers, holding toothbrush and toothpaste tube, is trying
to brush Burns' teeth for him. Burns swats him away.


3F14 TABLE DRAFT 7/20/95


BURNS
(SPITS) Really, Smithers, I'll be fine!
I'm sure your replacement will be able
to handle everything. (PEERS OUT DOOR)
Who is he, anyway?

SMITHERS
Homer Simpson, Sir. One of your organ


banks from sector 7-G. (BEAT) All the


recent events of your life have revolved


around him in some way.
BURNS


Simpson, eh?


INT. POWER PLANT - SMITHERS' OFFICE - CONTINUOUS


14.


Smithers comes out of Burns' office. A horn HONKS outside.


He picks up his suitcase and camera and puts on a pair of


sunglasses. Homer raises his hand.
HOMER
I don't understand 2700 of my new
duties.
SMITHERS
Well, that's my taxi. Uh, which one
duty is giving you the most trouble?
HOMER
Um, what do I do in case of fire?
There's a second, more insistent, horn HONK.
SMITHERS


I'm sorry. I've really gotta go.


3F14 TABLE DRAFT 7/20/95 LSi.


Smithers leaves. Homer sits quietly at his desk for a beat.
Then he turns to glance into Burns' office, and sees the
entire room is engulfed in flames. Burns sits obliviously at


his desk doing paperwork.


HOMER


(MOANS) Just my luck.
FADE
OUT:

ACT_ Two
FADE
IN:
INT. POWER PLANT - BURNS' OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
Homer, PANTING heavily, is putting out the last of the flames
with a fire extinguisher. Burns is still doing paperwork and
apparently hasn't noticed any of this. He looks up and is
startled.
BURNS
Good lord, Smithers! You look
atrocious. TI thought I told you to take
a vacation.
HOMER
Smithers already left, Sir. I'm his
replacement, Homer Simpson.
BURNS
Ah, yes, Simpson. I'll have my lunch
now. A single pillow of shredded wheat,
some steamed toast, and a dodo egg.
HOMER
But I think the dodo went extinct. -
BURNS
Get going! And answer those phones,
install a computer system, and rotate my
office so that window faces the hills.
HOMER
(HESITANTLY) Uh, okay, I'll go shred


that pillow you wanted.


3F14 TABLE DRAFT 7/20/95 17.


Homer backs out of the room.
EXT. SIMPSON HOUSE - ESTABLISHING - BEFORE DAWN
INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS


Homer staggers out of bed and begins struggling into his
pants.


HOMER
(LOW) Lousy two-legged pants.

MARGE
(SLEEPY) Homie, it's 4:30 in the
morning. Did you have that nightmare
about the smelly horse again?

HOMER
Yes, but I had to get up anyway. It's


time for me to make breakfast for Mr.


Burns.

MARGE
Poor Homie. Poor, poor... (FALLS
ASLEEP)


EXT. BURNS MANSION - FOYER - A LITTLE LATER

Homer uses his key to open the front door. As he steps
inside, he's immediately set upon by a pack of vicious
BARKING HOUNDS.
He struggles to enter a passcode into an
alarm keypad next to the door. When he finishes, the dogs
disperse and go back to sleep.

INT. BURNS MANSION - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS


Homer enters and looks around. The kitchen is full of weird-
looking 19th century kitchen appliances.


HOMER
Hmmm. One of these must be a breakfast


maker .


3F14 ‘TABLE DRAFT 7/20/95 18.


Homer looks helplessly around the kitchen for a moment, then
takes a deep breath, puts on a chef's hat and apron, and
begins rolling up his sleeves.
HOMER
(CONT'D)
(DETERMINED) Well, it's my job to cook
him breakfast, and I'm gonna cook the
best damned breakfast he ever ate!
SMASH CUT
TO:
INT. BURNS MANSION - BEDROOM - AN HOUR LATER
Homer enters with a bag of donuts and some Kwik-E-Mart
coffee. His clothes are spattered and his chef's hat is
burned. Mr. Burns sits up in bed and coldly examines his
breakfast.
BURNS
You call these three minute eggs? These


are dough-nuts!


Burns slaps the doughnuts to the floor with a newspaper, then
hands the paper to Homer.


BURNS
(CONT'D)
Here. Tell me how my stocks did
yesterday.


Homer turns to the stock page. It's swimming with minuscule
type.


HOMER
Uh... they all won.
BURNS
Eh? What about my options?
HOMER
Well, you can either get up or go back


to sleep.


3F14 TABLE DRAFT 7/20/95 19.


BURNS
(CONSIDERS) I believe I'll get up.
INT. BURNS MANSION - OUTSIDE THE BATHROOM - A LITTLE LATER
We hear bath water being run, then a back being SCRUBBED.
BURNS
(0.S.)
Scrub harder. Got to get that layer of
dead skin off.
We hear harder SCRUBBING.
HOMER
(0.S.)
(SHUDDER)
INT. BURNS MANSION - BEDROOM - A LITTLE LATER


Homer brings Burns a silver tray containing an assortment of
false teeth. Burns looks them over.


BURNS
I think the fangs today.
Homer picks up the false teeth with the fangs and puts them
into Burns' mouth. Then, after Burns has glared at him for a
few moments, he carefully closes Burns' mouth.


INT. POWER PLANT - OUTSIDE BURNS' OFFICE - NINE A.M.


Burns stands in front of the door. Homer waits. Burns keeps
looking at him, then at the door.


HOMER
(INNOCENTLY) Are we going to stand here
all day, Mr. Burns?

BURNS
Cretin.

HOMER
(CONT'D)
(REALIZING) Oh.


Homer opens the door and Burns steps inside.


3F14 TABLE DRAFT 7/20/95 20.


MONTAGE


1) We see Homer answering the constantly RINGING bank of
phones.


HOMER
Hello? 'Fraid not. (NEXT PHONE)
Hello? Nope, sorry. (NEXT PHONE) No,
can't help ya. (HANGS UP) (THINKS FOR
A BEAT) (CALLS 0.S.) Hey, are you
Montgomery?

BURNS
(0.S.)
Yes.

HOMER
(ANNOYED GRUNT) --n't worry. Those
calls weren't for you.


2) Burns sticks his head out of his office and glares at
Homer.


BURNS
Did you get that report on the
accounting department?

HOMER
(A LITTLE PROUD) Yes, sir, I did.


Homer takes a piece of paper out of his pocket, unfolds it,
and begins to read.


HOMER
(CONT'D)
The accounting department is located on
the third floor. Its hours are 9 a.m.
to 5 p.m. The head of this department


is a Mr. Johnson or Johnstone.


3F14 TABLE DRAPT 7/20/95 21.


Burns takes Homer's report, folds it neatly, puts it in an
envelope, seals it, and addresses the envelope to
"INCINERATOR." He passes Homer the envelope.


3) Homer reads a stack of messages to Burns. Burns gets
angrier as he hears each message.


HOMER
Here are your messages: "You have 30
minutes to move your car," "You have 10
minutes," "Your car has been impounded,"
“Your car has been crushed into a cube,"
“You have 30 minutes to move your cube."
The phone RINGS. Homer answers it.
HOMER
(INTO PHONE) Mr. Burns' office.
BURNS
(ANNOYED) Is it about my cube?
HOMER
It's Mr. Smithers calling for you.
EXT. TROPICAL BEACH -
DAY
Smithers is dressed in a suit, carrying a briefcase, and
standing rigidly next to the surf as he talks into a cellular
phone. Behind him, TWO MEN play volleyball.
SMITHERS
Is everything okay, sir? Because I'm


listed stand-by on every flight out of


here.


3F14 TABLE DRAFT 7/20/95


INT. POWER PLANT - BURNS' OFFICE
BURNS

Everything's fine, Smithers. Though
this Simpson fellow seems to be getting
dumber by the minute. I've never seen
anything quite like it... Anyhoo, you
just enjoy your vacation.

Homer looks a little hurt.


INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - THAT EVENING


22.


Homer is slumped on the couch, totally exhausted. Bart and


Lisa enters.

HOMER
(SNORING)

BART
(TWO CLAPS) Look alive, Simpson! I'm
not paying you to goldbrick!

HOMER
(WAKING UP SNORTS) Yes, sir!

BART
Now get cracking on my long division.
And don't forget to show your work,
Simpson.

HOMER
(GROGGY) I'll have it on your desk in
the morning, sir.

LISA


Bart, leave Simpson alone.


Lisa surreptitiously leans over to whisper in Homer's ear.

LISA
(CONT'D)
(WHISPERING) Simpson! I need a ride to
the library.
Marge enters.
MARGE
Kids, stop exploiting your father.
Homie, why don't you lie down and relax.
HOMER
No time, Marge. I think Mr. Burns
wanted me to do some long division.
MARGE
Simpson! Lie down!
Homer obediently falls back onto the couch.
MARGE
(CONT'D)
Sorry, but you need a good night's rest.
HOMER
(RESTFUL SIGH)
BURNS
(V.O.)
Simpson!
We hear the DEAFENING CLANGING of a bell.
INT. BURNS MANSION - MASTER BEDROOM - SIMULTANEOUS
Burns sits up in bed, softly ringing a tiny bell into the end
of a megaphone. We PULL BACK TO REVEAL that the megaphone
extends out the window, where it grows to gigantic
proportions. Homer runs in, HUFFING and PUFFING.
BURNS
The telephone has been ringing for some


time. Answer it.


3F14 TABLE DRAFT 7/20/95 24.


We see the RINGING phone sitting on Burns' night table, just
inches from his hand. Homer picks up the receiver and
listens for a moment.
HOMER
It's for you.
He places the phone to Burns' ear.
INT. TROPICAL NIGHT CLUB - SIMULTANEOUS
Smithers is calling from a night club where "Relax" by
Frankie Goes to Hollywood is playing. In the background, we
see DANCING COUPLES that don't seem to include women.
Smithers has loosened up enough that he's now wearing a
Hawaiian shirt and shorts instead of a suit and tie.
SMITHERS
Mr. Burns, 48 rings! Are you all right?
(SUSPICIOUS) What did Simpson do to
you?
INT. BURNS' MANSION -
BEDROOM
BURNS
(INTO PHONE) Nothing other than drive
me to distraction with his incompetent
boobery. Terrible at everything. A
complete moron. (SOTTO, CUPPING HAND TO
RECEIVER) But I'm not really free to
talk right now.
Homer furrows his brow, a little peeved.
BURNS
(CONT'D)
(INTO PHONE) Stop calling me and start

INT. TROPICAL NIGHT
CLUB
SMITHERS
Ah... actually, Sir, picture taking is
not allowed at this particular resort.
(HURRIEDLY) I've got to go now --
there's a line forming behind me.


Smithers hangs up just as a CONGA LINE passes by. The line
grabs him by the waist and pulls him in.


SMITHERS
(CONT'D)
Yah! Watch the sunburn!
EXT. POWER PLANT - NEXT DAY


Homer walks up to the plant gate. He hesitates, suppresses
an involuntary shudder, then stands up straight and walks in.


MONTAGE


1) As Homer stands by, Burns FLICKS on his desk lamp and
recoils in horror.


BURNS
(PAINED CRY) 60 watts! I don't have
the eyes of a teenager, you lamebrain!
Get me a 59 watt bulb.


2) Burns sits in bed, wearing what appears to be a dunce
cap.


BURNS
I asked for light starch on my nightcap!
Burns takes off the cap and jabs Homer with the point.
HOMER
(BEING JABBED NOISES)


3) Burns throws a cup of something in Homer's face.


3F14 TABLE DRAFT 7/20/95 26:4


BURNS
You call this Postum?!
4) Burns knocks over a giant stack of papers.
BURNS
You call this a tax return?!


5) Burns beats a huge Cray super-computer with his cane,
causing it to spark and smoke on Homer.


BURNS
You call this a computer system?!
6) We see a series of lightning-fast close-ups of Burns
yelling angrily and throwing books, pencils, etc. at Homer.
Homer grows angrier and angrier until he can't take it
anymore.
HOMER
(CRY OF RAGE)
Finally, unexpectedly, Homer punches Burns in the face.
Burns drops to the floor and lies motionless. There's a
stunned moment, in which the only sound we hear is the clock
on the wall TICKING. Then Homer WHIMPERS with fear and runs
out the door.
INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - A FEW MINUTES LATER
Homer runs WHIMPERING into the house and up the stairs.
MARGE
How was work today, Homer?
INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - A MINUTE LATER


Marge and the kids enter and look curiously around the room.
No Homer. They hear WHIMPERING coming from under the bed.


LISA
Dad's under the bed again.


Marge bends down and looks under the bed at Homer. He
scrabbles backwards away from her.

MARGE
Is there something wrong, Homer?


HOMER,


MARGE
(PROMPTING HIM) Except...
HOMER
Except I killed Mr. Burns.
MARGE
(PANICKED) Oh my God! (HYPERVENTILATES)


Marge takes a folding fan from her pocket, flips it open, and
fans herself frantically.


LISA
What happened, Dad?

HOMER
I punched Burns right in his 104 year-
old face.

LISA
Are you sure he's dead? Maybe you just
really really hurt him.

MARGE
Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Maybe
everything's all right. Maybe if you go
apologize, he won't even fire you.
(AFTERTHOUGHT) If he's alive.

INT. POWER PLANT - OUTSIDE BURNS' OFFICE - NEXT DAY


Homer walks up to the door of Burns' office, takes a deep
breath, then knocks on the door.

P.O.V.


The room seems to be empty. We hear labored BREATHING coming
from somewhere. We continue to pan, passing the top of
Burns' head, which is sticking up from behind a potted plant.
Then we quickly pan back and zoom in on the head.


ON
HOMER


He walks over to the potted plant and looks behind it. Burns
cowers there, disheveled and sporting a black eye.


BURNS
/HOMER,
(SHORT SCREAM)
HOMER
I'm really sorry I hit you, Mr. Burns.
Here, let me put some salt on that eye.
BURNS
(TERRIFIED) No, please! I can't bear
another thrashing. Just leave me be.
HOMER
Yes, sir.
Homer exits. Burns crouches farther down behind the plant.
INT. POWER PLANT - BURNS' OFFICE - LATER
Burns rushes over to the phone on his desk.
BURNS
Must call Smithers. He'll protect me
from this beast.


Burns picks up the phone and looks at it curiously.

I've seen people activate this machine a

Success! It's ringing!
INT. MOE'S TAVERN -
SIMULTANEOUS
Moe picks up the phone.
BURNS
(V.O.)
I'm looking for a Mr. Smithers. First
name, Waylon.
Moe looks at the phone. His eyes narrow.
MOE
Oh, so you're looking for a Mr.
Smithers, eh? First name, Waylon, is
it? (SUDDENLY VICIOUS) Listen you...
when I catch you, I'm going to pull out
your eyes and shove 'em up your butt so
you can watch me kick the crap out of
you. Then I'm going to use your tongue
to paint my boat.
INT. POWER PLANT - BURNS' OFFICE - SIMULTANEOUS
Burns stares at the phone in horror. He hangs up slowly,
then puts a heavy book on top of the phone, then an ottoman


on top of that. Then he walks carefully over to his potted
plant and crouches behind it.


3F14 TABLE DRAFT 7/20/95 30.


BURNS
Smithers, if only you could hear me.
Why, oh why, did I leave my giant
megaphone at home?
EXT. TROPICAL BEACH - THAT MINUTE


Smithers is driving a powerboat. Suddenly, he cocks his head
as if he's heard something.


SMITHERS
(GASP) Something tells me Mr. Burns
needs me.
He instinctively yanks the throttle back, stopping the boat
dead. WE PULL BACK TO REVEAL he was towing a pyramid of TEN
WATER-SKIING MEN
who now glide helplessly up to the boat and
tumble onto the deck.
WATER-SKIER
What's wrong, Waylon?
SMITHERS
Nothing, I guess.
WATER-SKIER
(GENTLY) You're thinking about Mr.
Burns, aren't you?
Smithers nods sheepishly.
WATER-SKIER

INT. POWER PLANT - BURNS' OFFICE - AFTERNOON
Burns, now quite haggard and with five o'clock shadow,
crouches near the entrance to his office. He slides a hand
mirror under the door, attempting to survey the outer office.
BURNS
Praise God, I think the thug has finally
gone home for the day. Now I can make


my escape...


Suddenly, Homer's reflection looms grotesquely in the mirror.
He smiles, and Burns rears back with a YELP.


HOMER
(EAGER TO PLEASE) Hi, Mr. Burns. Do
you want your coffee now?
BURNS
(SLIGHT PANIC) Uh... mo! I'm... uh...
making it myself!
Burns picks up the coffee pot and RATTLES it at the door.
BURNS
(CONT'D)
Hear that? No need to come in! The
percolations are imminent!
Burns regards the coffee pot, turning it this way and that.
BURNS
(CONT'D)
(LOW, TO HIMSELF) I wonder which part
is the coffee?
INT. POWER PLANT - BURNS' OFFICE - LATER
Homer peeks in. Burns is drinking a cup of coffee. The
office is a mess. A fifty pound sack of coffee is torn open


and spilling on the floor. Coffee grounds are spattered on
the walls and ceiling.


3F14 TABLE DRAPT 7/20/95 32.


BURNS
(NERVOUS) Stay back, Homer! Approach
no further. Coffee's already made. I
stomped the beans myself.
HOMER
Well, can I at least drive you home, Mr.
Burns? It's five o'clock.
BURNS
No... uh... I thought, wh, I'd chauffeur
myself this evening! Yes, that's what I
thought. After all, how different can
driving a limousine be from paying for
one?
EXT. STREET - THAT
NIGHT
Burns' long limo cuts a corner way too sharply, knocking over
mailboxes and streetlights. CHIEF WIGGUM dives out of the
way.
WIGGUM
(GRUMBLES) That'd be illegal if it
weren't a limo.


Burns continues on his way, happily HONKING as he careens
through PEDESTRIAN-filled intersections.


INT. BURNS' CAR -
SIMULTANEOUS
We see him turning the steering wheel back and forth in


exaggerated arcs, like a three year-old, as the car knocks
down stop signs and fire hydrants.

BURNS
I can't believe it! All my life I've
avoided doing things for myself, but I'm

ESTABLISHING SHOT - POWER PLANT - NEXT DAY
INT. POWER PLANT - MEN'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Burns washes his hands at the sink.

He does so.

HOMER
Would you like me to shred those
environmental reports for you, sir?
BURNS
(CONFIDENT, ALMOST JOVIAL) Already
taken care of.


We hear a GRINDING sound as a pile of paper shreds are

extruded from the shredder. Burns CHUCKLES and tosses the
remnants out the window. He turns and offers Homer a small


cup.
BURNS
Cappuccino, Simpson?
The phone RINGS. Homer reaches for it, but Burns' bony
beats him to it. Burns confidently tosses the receiver
one hand to the other, then raises it to his ear.
BURNS
(CONT'D)
(INTO PHONE) Ahoy-hoy? (BEAT) No,

BURNS
No, Homer. You've already done more for
me than any man. Your brutal attack
forced me to fend for myself. I realize
now that being waited on hand and foot
is okay for your average Joe, but it's
not for me. I want to thank you.
Burns clasps Homer's hand, then hugs him tight.
BURNS
(CONT'D)


Thank you, thank you, thank you!


35.


Just then, Smithers walks in the door. He sees Burns hugging
Homer and drops one of his bags in shock. Several pineapples


fall out and roll across the floor.

SMITHERS
Oh my God! I knew I shouldn't have
left!

BURNS
Ah, welcome back, Smithers. You look
rested. Say, do you know Homer Simpson?
He pitched in around the office while
you were away. (TO HOMER) Bang up job,
Simpson, but I guess it's back to your


trusty post in sector 7-G.


Burns gives Homer a good-natured, playful punch on the chin.
Smithers breathes a SIGH OF RELIEF, then holds the door open


for Homer.
SMITHERS,


You heard the man, Simpson.


3F14 TABLE DRAFT 7/20/95 36.


BURNS
Ah, and my dear, dear Smithers... you're
no longer needed at all. You're fired.

Burns looks down and resumes his paperwork. Smithers turns
to Homer with a pathetic incredulous look. Homer returns the
gaze, concerned.

HOMER
Hey, congratulations!
SMITHERS
Actually, I showed them how they could
get more productivity from their staff
by fostering an atmosphere of fear and
paranoia. Then they immediately fired
me aS an example to the others.
MARGE
You know what? I bet Ned Flanders could
use a right-hand man over at the
Leftorium. Why don't you try there?
SMITHERS
Thanks for the tip. Is it okay if I use

Burns is in bed, with a cast on his arm. Smithers is spoon
feeding him.


SMITHERS
Here comes the endangered condor into
the power lines.
Burns chews. Smithers places Burns' teddy bear next to him.
SMITHERS
(CONT'D)
I've got Bobo, hot from the dryer!
Careful not to burn yourself on his
eyes.
BURNS
I don't need you to do any of this. I'm
totally self-reliant now. What I would
like, though, is a Spanish peanut.
Burns opens his mouth (a la the final scene of "A Clockwork
Orange") for Smithers to feed him. Smithers produces a bowl
of nuts and holds one up to Burns' mouth.
BURNS

Smithers peels the red skin off the nut, then places it in

SMITHERS
I already have, sir.

INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - SIMULTANEOUS
Homer marvels at a lavish gift basket of fruit, deli meats,
etc., on the coffee table in front of him. Bart and Lisa
look on as Homer digs in.
BART
What did you get that for?
HOMER
For knocking Mr. Burns out a third story
window.
BART
(SHRUGS) Makes sense to me.
LISA
Did he die?
HOMER


What am I -- a doctor?

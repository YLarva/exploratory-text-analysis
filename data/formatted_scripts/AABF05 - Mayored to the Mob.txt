The FAMILY is watching TV.
TV ANNOUNCER
(V.O.)
And now, the conclusion of our Thousand
Dollar Movie -- Roger Corman’s...
Titanic!
On TV, a YOUNG MAN in black tie and tails and a WOMAN in a
bikini drift in a lifeboat, surrounded by cheesy plywood
icebergs. They watch a fake Titanic sink straight down
without tilting. There’s a MOAN OF TWISTING METAL that
does not match the shot. Then it’s eerily calm.
YOUNG
MAN
We’re safe now, Clarice. We made it
away from that cursed ship.
YOUNG
WOMAN
Now I can relax and take off this
stifling bikini.
She starts to take off her top. Unseen by them, the giant
ship SURFACES to TENSE MUSIC, and begins to advance
menacingly through the fog. The four smokestacks SPEW
FIRE, and Titanic’s mouth opens like a shark’s.

Well, I’d rather get a message than see
another lousy commercial.


TWO HIDEOUS ALIENS
(in bad costumes) appear onscreen. They
are at a spaceship console. Both are working joysticks.

The crowd SCREAMS as he FIRES UP his light saber. He takes
a couple of half-hearted SWINGS at cardboard cut-outs of

EXT. BODYGUARD SCHOOL - PARADE GROUNDS ~ SIMULTANEOUS
Homer and several TRAINEES, including GIL and KIRK VAN
HOUTEN, stand at attention as the instructor, LEAVELLE,
reviews his recruits. He wears a tan suit and Stetson hat.
LEAVELLE
As a bodyguard, your only loyalty is to ~
your pro-tectee. Not to your family.
Not to your country. (POINTING IN
HOMER’S FACE) Not to Mu-hammad.
HOMER
Even during Ramadan?
LEAVELLE
Shut your sass-hole, boy.
Two ASSISTANTS WHEEL IN some wagons full of watermelons x

in the wagon) and begin handing them out. Each melon has
the name of a famous person written on it.
LEAVELLE
(CONT’D)
These melons represent your pro-
tectees. Throughout this course, you
will pro-tect your personal melon as if
it was paying your salary.
We see that Homer has already almost completely devoured *


his watermelon. The name on it is “ANN LANDERS." His face

CROWD OF
NERDS
Mr. Skywalker! Mr. Skywalker! / Sign
this! / Use the force! Use the force!
/ (QUICKLY) Wookie! Wookie! Wookie!
MARK
HAMILL
(ANNOYED SOUND, THEN) Homer, I think
you know what to do.
MUSIC:. "BODYGUARD" THEME


Homer scoops Mark into his arms and strides purposefully
into the crowd, dramatically KICKING nerds away.


HOMER
(GRUNTS) Get out of there! (GRUNTS)


As the music continues, we go to an OVERHEAD SHOT of Homer
and Mark making their way through the sea of dorks.


MARK HAMILL
(V.0O.)
Shoot! I forgot my light saber.


From the OVERHEAD SHOT we see Homer turn around, still


carrying Mark, KICKING his way through the nerds back to
the theater.


HOMER
(GRUNTS) Get out of the way you--
(GRUNTS)

MARK HAMILL
(V.0.)
Oh, wait, here re is.


As the music continues, Homer again turns around.

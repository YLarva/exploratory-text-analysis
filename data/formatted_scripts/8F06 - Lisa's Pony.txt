IN:
SUPER: THE DAWN OF MAN


A bunch of APES are squatting and GRUNTING on the African
plain. We see ONE who looks a lot like Homer.


MUSIC: HEAVENLY CHOIR
The black monolith from 2001: A Space Odyssey has appeared
on the plain. The apes approach the slab curiously and
touch it, GRUNTING and HOOTING.
MUSIC: THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA
Suddenly one ape picks up a bone and uses it like a hammer
Another BANGS two stones together to make a small fire. A
third is tinkering with a crude stone wheel. PAN OVER to
see the Homer-ape who is looking at the monolith. He gets
an idea.
HOMER-APE
(INSPIRED) Oooh.


The Homer-ape lies against the monolith, and begins to take
a snooze. He has invented GOOFING OFF.


HOMER-APE
(ADJUSTING HIMSELF) Ahhh.
The Homer-ape drifts of to sleep, SNORING.
MATCH CUT
TO:
INT. NUCLEAR POWER PLANT -- DAY
HOMER
is SNORING in his chair at work, with his feet


propped up on the console. He makes ape-like GRUNTS in his
sleep.

INT. SPRINGFIELD ELEMENTARY AUDITORIUM - BACKSTAGE
LISA
wears a formal dress as she talks on the phone.
Behind her other acts are getting ready for the school
talent show. One BOY "plays" Lara’s Theme on glasses of
water by RUBBING THE RIMS.
LISA
(INTO PHONE) Dad, I’m calling about
the school talent show.
INTERCUT
HOMER
(INTO PHONE) Don’t worry, I know it’s
tonight.
Homer glances over to see "Talent Show 7:00" on his nuclear
workers pin-up calendar. On it, "Miss Atomic Pile" wears a
bikini and work gloves, and fondles a glowing plutonium
rod.
LISA
(URGENTLY) No. Dad, I broke my last
saxophone reed, and I need you to get
me a new one.
HOMER
Uh... isn’t this the kind of thing your


mother’s better at?


8F06 FINAL DELIVERY 5/3/1 3.


LISA
I called her. She’s not home. I also
tried Mr. Flanders, Aunt Patty, Aunt
Selma, Dr. Hibbert, Reverend Lovejoy
and that nice man who caught the snake
in our basement.
HOMER
Wow! And after them, out of all the
people in the world, you chose me. Uh
huh, yeah, number four and a half reed.
Homer writes "4 1/2 REED" on the bottom of his shoe. Next
to it on the shoe is a hole with an arrow pointing to it
labelled, "Fix This."
INT. SPRINGFIELD ELEMENTARY - AUDITORIUM - NIGHT
PRINCIPAL SKINNER
addresses the CROWD.
SKINNER
Well, you’re in for a whale of a show
tonight. I/’d like to point out that
the doors are now locked, so you
parents can’t sneak out of the show
after your own child has performed. Oh,
and let me caution the people in the


first five rows, you will get wet.


EXT. MUSIC STORE -
EVENING


Homer runs up to a store labeled "King Toot’s Music Store",
with a picture of an Egyptian Pharaoh playing a trumpet.
Below it a sign reads "Open 10 to 7". Homer looks at his
watch -- it reads 6:55.

MOE’S TAVERN - CONTINUOUS
Moe is fixing Homer a draft beer.
HOMER
Hurry, Moe, hurry! I’ve only got five

HOMER
Hey, do I tell you how to do your job?
MOE
Sorry, Homer.

You know, if you tip the glass, there
won’t be so much foam on top.
MOE

MILHOUSE

hands, his head, and on his teeth with a spoon. Offstage
Skinner talks to MRS. KRABAPPEL.
SKINNER
Terrible, just terrible. You know,


they seem to get worse every year.


Milhouse finishes and staggers off groggily, as Skinner
comes out APPLAUDING.


SKINNER
(CONT’D)
Wonderful. I think this is the best
batch we/ve ever had. I really do.
And now, here’s Bart Simpson, The Boy
of a Thousand Voices.
Bart enters.
BART
I’d like to open with my impression of
Principal Skinner.
Bart turns his back to the audience in Rich Little style,
then turns back -- he has a moronic drooling expression,
with one finger up his nose and the other arm dragging like
Quasimodo.
BART
(CONT’D)
(IDIOT VOICE) Duh, look at me, I’m
Principal Skinner.


The KIDS in the crowd GO APE. In the wings, Principal
Skinner turns to Mrs. Krabappel.

Let me think about it... Eh... No.

That’s it. I want you to see a picture

MOE
(TO LITTLE MAN) Come on, Jer. Open

you and your wife out of that burning
car?

LITTLE
MAN
(GRUDGINGLY) Okay. Okay. But now
we're even. (TO HOMER) So what does
your daughter need?

HOMER
(SMOOTHLY) I’11 have you know, I wrote
it down.


Homer clumsily hops up and down on one leg as he reads the
bottom of his shoe.


HOMER
(CONT’D)
Number Four and a half -- Stupid gum!
Homer pulls a piece of gum off the bottom of his shoe.

A dreamcloud appears above Marge as she pictures what might
have happened to Homer.


A) We see Homer changing a tire on the side of the freeway.
MARGE
(V.0. CONT’D)
Maybe.
B) We see Homer in a tree with a bear GROWLING underneath.
MARGE

dissect Homer.


MARGE

This act is over! (CLEARS THROAT)
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I’d like to
put this filth behind us, and let’s all
enjoy Lisa Simpson’s rendition of
"Stormy Leather -- ah, Weather."


Lisa nervously walks onstage and begins to PLAY "Rhapsody
in Blue." After a few notes, she hits a SQUEAKY note.


NELSON
Haw haw!
Shaken, Lisa continues PLAYING, hitting more SQUEAKY SOUR
NOTES.
The audience members GRIMACE and WINCE. Several
people put their hands to their ears. CLOSE ON JASPER as
he turns his hearing aid off.
GROUNDSKEEPER
WILLY
Sounds like that gopher I caught in me
lawnmower.


EXT. AUDITORIUM - AT THAT MOMENT


Homer is rushing to the auditorium clutching the reed. He
HEARS
the horrible music.

HOMER
Uh-oh.
Skinner comes back on stage. He gestures for Lisa to stop.
SKINNER
That’1ll do.
LISA
(SADLY) It’s not my fault. It’s the
reed.
SKINNER
(VERY PATRONIZING) Oh yes, of course.
It’s the reed.
Lisa leaves the stage.
SKINNER
(CONT’D)
Let’s hear it for Lisa Simpson and her
wacky sax.


Homer starts to APPLAUD and YELL. Everyone in the audience
looks at him. He STOPS. Marge MURMURS angrily.


INT. SPRINGFIELD ELEMENTARY - BACKSTAGE - AFTER THE SHOW
Homer is wandering around backstage. He stops a KID
dressed as the Jackson 5 - he is flanked by four life-size
dummies.
HOMER
Hey, any of you guys seen Lisa Simpson?


The kid and four dummies point in unison. We see Lisa
sadly dismantling her sax and putting it away.


HOMER

Lisa, would you like some ice cream?

mustache, riding an 1890’s bicycle with a big front wheel,
eating an ice cream cone. Beneath it is a pimply faced
ponytailed TEENAGE EMPLOYEE wearing a straw boater and
smoking a cigarette. He pushes a wheelbarrow with a huge
ice cream sundae on it up to Homer and Lisa’s table.
TEENAGER
Okay, who ordered the Mount Bellyache?
HOMER


(SWEETLY) I ordered it for my little


girl. Heh... heh.


The employee sets it down in front of a sullen Lisa. She
takes one small bite.


LISA
I’m done.
HOMER
(MOANS) That cost eighty-eight dollars!
LISA
I’m sorry dad, I don’t feel much like
eating.
HOMER
Look, I let you down and I apologize.
I know that doesn’t make it right, but
I hope you can find it in your heart to
forgive me.

I forgive you.

A tear rolls down Homer’s cheek. Marge enters.
HOMER
No wonder she hates me. (SOBBING) She
hates me. I never paid any attention
to her.
MARGE


Homer, Lisa loves you.


HOMER
Does not.

MARGE
Does to.

with Lisa just spend some time with

her. Do things with her, show her you

care.

HOMER

(LONG PAINFUL MOAN)
MONTAGE
1) Homer, perched in a tiny chair, is having a "tea party"
with Lisa -- drinking out of tiny teacups, eating imaginary
cookies, etc. Bart and Milhouse appear at the door behind
Homer. They mimic him and LAUGH uproariously. Homer
lunges for them, upsetting the tea table.
2) Lisa’s in a plastic playhouse looking through the
window sadly. Homer is trying to squeeze through the
doorway and gets stuck. He stands up, lifting the house
off its foundation.
3) Homer is pushing Lisa on a swing. He pushes her higher
and higher. Homer gives a mighty shove and GROANS with
exertion. The swing flies out of frame -- when it comes
back into frame, it’s empty. Homer looks embarrassed.


4) Homer has just washed Lisa’s hair and is now combing
and BLOW=-DRYING it.

HOMER
Maybe I should just cut my losses, give
up on Lisa, and make a fresh start with
Maggie.

MARGE
Homie, you’ve got to stop looking for
the quick fix. If you keep spending
time with Lisa, she’ll forgive you..

HOMER
Marge, if I spend any more time doing
these girl things, I’m gonna -- you
know -- go fruity. (MAKES FLITTING
GESTURES) No, you were right the first
time with that quick fix idea. I know!
I’1l get her that pony she’s always
bugging me for.

MARGE
We can’t afford to buy a pony.

HOMER
(SAGELY) Marge, with today’s gasoline
prices, we can’t afford not to buy a
pony.

MARGE


That’s ridiculous.


TD's


8FO6 FINAL DELIVERY


HOMER
Marge, I’ve got to get her a pony.
When I look in Lisa’s eyes, I don’t see
love anymore.
MARGE
That’s no reason to buy a pony!
HOMER
See, even when you yell at me, I can
see love in your eyes.
MARGE
Stick to the subject.
HOMER
Ha ha, you love me.
MARGE
(SIGHS) Let’s be realistic. A pony is
very expensive and we have enough
trouble paying bills as it is.
HOMER
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
MARGE
You sound like you’re going to buy a
pony. Promise me you won't.
HOMER
Mm.
MARGE

Mr. Simpson, what sort of pony are you
interested in?

HOMER
One that’s real quiet, and doesn’t eat
or drink too much.

MILLICENT
Sir, what you have just described is a
camel.

HOMER
Look, lady, I’m buying this pony for my
little girl, and I don’t care what it
costs.

MILLICENT
(POINTING TO PONY) Very good. That
stunning creature over there is half a
million dollars.

HOMER

MILLICENT
He was sired by Secretariat and his
mother won the Kentucky Derby.

Homer writes out a check and hands it to Millicent.
MILLICENT
Mr. Simpson, this check is dated
January 1, 2054.
HOMER
Is there a problem with that?
Millicent stuffs the check back in Homer’s pocket.
MILLICENT
(COLDLY) Our ponies start at five
thousand dollars. Cash.
Homer starts to leave, then turns.
HOMER

ran away from home?
MILLICENT
I sincerely hope not.

Isn’t that cute? Smithers, he’s

(SUSPICIOUS) That is it, isn’t it?
You’re not planning to eat it?

No. I need to get it for my little

SMITHERS
Shut up, Simpson.

HOMER
Sorry.

Lisa awakens, then looks beside her. There is a pony’s
head on the pillow beside her a la The Godfather. She
SCREAMS, waking the pony which licks her face. Lisa pulls
back the blanket revealing the rest of the horse. She hugs
it joyfully, GASPS, then SIGHS contentedly..

Homer and Marge awaken when the door CRASHES open - Lisa
rides in on her pony.


LISA
I love you, Dad!
Homer smiles - she means it. Marge MURMURS. The horse
REARS
in a dramatic pose. Lisa GALLOPS OFF to the THEME
from "The Magnificent Seven" SCREAMING.
INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - STAIRWAY - MORNING
Marge and Homer are coming down in their nightclothes.
MARGE
(ANNOYED MURMUR) I am very upset

HOMER

angling for a pony of her own.
They enter the KITCHEN and Marge GASPS.
INT. SIMPSON HOUSE -

The kids are eating breakfast as the pony CLOMPS around the
kitchen. Lisa strokes it and feeds it sugar from the sugar
bowl.
BART


Hey, how come Lisa gets a pony?


8F06 FINAL DELIVERY 5/3/1 30.


HOMER
Because she stopped loving me.
BART
I don’t love you either. So give me
a moped.
Homer looks in Bart’s eyes.
HOMER
I know you love me. So you don’t get
squat. Hee hee hee.
Lisa introduces the pony to the dog and cat.
LISA
Snowball II... Santa’s Little
Helper... this is Princess. Please
don’t exclude her because she’s
different.


Maggie dips her pacifier in her food and lets the horse
SUCK
on it. Marge re-enters.


MARGE
(ANGRY) Homer, just where were you
planning to keep this horse?

HOMER
(SMUGLY) I’ve got it all figured
out. By day it will roam free around
the neighborhood. And at night it
will nestle snugly between the cars
in our garage.

LISA


Dad, no!


8F06 FINAL DELIVERY 5/3/1

That’s for the courts to decide.

She beckons and Homer leans down. Lisa KISSES him on the

INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - KITCHEN - LATE THAT NIGHT


Homer and Marge are going through the family finances.
Marge has files full of bills in front of her.

Well you know, we’re always buying
Maggie vaccinations for diseases she

MARGE
Actually, I was thinking we could cut
down on your beer.

HOMER
Nah, we’re not gonna be doing that.

MARGE
Well, then mayby you should consider
giving the pony back.

HOMER
First you didn’t want me to get the
pony. Now, you want me to take it
back. Make up your mind.

MARGE
Alright, then. I guess you’re just
going to have to come up with more
money.

HOMER
Fine. I will. There’s plenty of
money out there for a guy who knows
how to make it. (BEAT) Do you have
any jewelry you don’t need any more?


Marge MURMURS.

We see Lisa from behind, brushing the horse. She steps
back -- the pony is immaculately groomed, with a braided
mane.
LISA
You’re so beautiful.

Lisa is filthy from the effort, her face covered with dirt.
LISA

Oh look. You haven’t touched your

the salt lick. The pony licks along with her.

The kids run in to see Homer asleep on the floor, SNORING
LOUDLY.


MONTAGE


1) Homer is working at the Quik-E-Mart. He looks around,
then steals a beef jerky.


HOMER
Mmm... salty.
Homer looks around, then washes it down by drinking Blue
Squishee mix right from the nozzle. Apu enters, startling
him.
APU
Homer, are you stealing Squishees?
Homer replies, revealing his tongue is blue.


HOMER


No sir.

8FO6 FINAL DELIVERY 5/3/1 42.


2) Lisa is at the stables. She’s finishing playing a song
for her horse on her saxophone.


LISA
This next song is also about a girl
and her pony. It’s called
"Wildfire."
We HEAR the opening notes to "WILDFIRE" by Michael Murphy.


3) A young teenage BOY walks up to a sleepy Homer at the
counter with a sixpack of beer.


BOY
(TEENAGE VOICE) Yeah, six pack of
malt liquor please.

HOMER
Let me see some I.D.


The boy hands him a driver’s license with Jasper’s picture
on it. A bleary-eyed Homer compares it to the boy.


HOMER
(CONT’D)
Yeah, it’s you all right.
4) Homer is asleep at the nuclear plant console. His hand
is frozen a few inches from his open mouth, holding a
donut. Smithers walks by.
SMITHERS


Simpson, get to work.


Homer CHOMPS at the donut industriously. He opens his
eyes. They are incredibly bloodshot.


5) Apu is in bed with PRINCESS CASHMERE. They are in a
bizarre, intricate Kama Sutra position.


PRINCSS
CASHMERE

quietly counts out money for his groceries, trying not to


disturb Homer.
FLANDERS


(QUIETLY) Three dollars and fifty-
one... fifty-two... fifty-three

Flanders exits as Apu enters with Princess Cashmere on his
arm. He is shocked to see the sleeping Homer.


APU

your post! Now go change the
expiration dates on the dairy


products.

out.


APU

Shaking his head, Apu gets behind the counter.

Apu looks up to see Homer lying asleep in the doorway. The
automatic doors repeatedly BANG him in the head.


INT.
HOMER’S CAR - 8 A.M.
Homer is sleepily driving home.
HOMER’S POV


We see the road as Homer drives. Homer’s eyelids
repeatedly begin to close, blocking out the screen. Then
the screen goes BLACK for a beat. When his eyes reopen, we
are in Homer’s dream. It is night. All the CARS on the
road have been replaced by MOVING BEDS with PEOPLE sleeping
in them. A bunk bed HONKS like a diesel truck and goes
past him.


MUSIC: "GOLDEN SLUMBERS'"! BY THE BEATLES


Homer passes a sign reading: "Now Entering Dreamland:

Gas, Food, Beds." The car SAILS off a cliff, but before it
can fall ANGELS grab the car and hold it aloft. The MAN IN
THE MOON
winks at Homer.


EXT.
HOMER’S CAR


We see a sleeping Homer at the wheel. The car, dragging a
section of fence behind it, barrels into the Simpson
garage. It fishtails sideways SLAMMING into the wall. As
Homer wearily climbs out of the car, a power saw falls off
the shelf sideways, HITTING him on the head.

you give up that pony.
BART
(SMACKING HIS FIST) I can make her.
Just give me five minutes alone with
her.
MARGE
No, Bart. No one’s going to make

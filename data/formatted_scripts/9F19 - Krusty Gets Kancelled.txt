It’s the Springfield Squares!
The camera PANS OVER to a "Hollywood Squares" type setup on
a beach. Springfield celebrities such as MCBAIN, LURLEEN
LUMPKIN, TROY MCCLURE, THE CAPITAL CITY GOOFBALL, etc. are
in the squares. KENT BROCKMAN, the host, is wearing a
Hawaiian shirt.

MCBAIN
My son returns from a fancy east
coast college and I’m horrified to
find he’s a nerd.

KENT
BROCKMAN
(LAUGHING) I’m laughing already.

MCBAIN
It’s not a comedy.

KENT
BROCKMAN
Oh.


Suddenly a coast guard cutter appears in the water behind
the squares.


COAST GUARD
OFFICER
Attention! This is the coast guard.
A fifty foot tidal wave is heading
this way. All game shows off the
beach!


The stars start panicking. We see BARRY WHITE in an upper
square, which is decorated like a "swinging singles" pad.


BARRY
WHITE
Everybody up to my square! It’s safe
and it’s sexy. Oh baby.
The panicky celebrities climb up to his square. We see a

Homer and Bart are watching TV.
HOMER
He’s dead now.
Homer and Bart share a LAUGH.

The word GABBO, in huge white letters, flashes irritatingly
on the screen.

Homer and Bart look at each other.
BART
Did you see that?
HOMER
Yeah.

What’s Gabbo?

HOMER
I figure it’s some guy’s name. (BEAT)
Some guy named Gabbo.
EXT. SPRINGFIELD EXPRESSWAY -
DAY
MARGE’S head is sticking out of the car window.
MARGE
Gabbo is coming?
We PULL BACK to reveal that she’s staring up at a huge
billboard that says "Gabbo Is Coming." A long line of cars
crawls along behind her. All the DRIVERS are gaping up at
the billboard.
BEHIND THE
BILLBOARD
LOU, on a motorcycle, aims a radar gun at the traffic.
LOU
(READING GUN) According to the radar
gun, nobody’s speeding.
WIGGUM
Lemme try mine. Maybe it’1l give a
phony reading, heh heh.


He pulls out a gun and FIRES it, shooting tear gas into the
crowd.


LOU
Chief, that’s your tear gas gun.
Wiggum looks at the COUGHING crowd.

Burns slicks back his hair in anticipation.
MONTAGE
A) Newspaper headline: "Five Days Till Gabbo."
B) LOVEJOY is delivering a thunderous sermon.
LOVEJOY
Everyone is saying "Gabbo this" and
"Gabbo that." But no one is saying
"Worship this" and "Jericho that."
JASPER
raises his hand.
JASPER


What’s this about Gabbo?


9F19 FINAL DELIVERY 10/2/92


C) KENT BROCKMAN sits in front of a mortise: the word
"Gabbo" surrounded by question marks.


KENT
BROCKMAN
Remember: Don’t look directly at
Gabbo, just in case whatever he is,
is too bright. Scientists recommend
viewing him through a piece of smoked
glass.


D) WIGGUM is looking out the window at a huge billboard
that says "Watch Out For Gabbo."


LOU
We got nothin’ on this Gabbo guy,

If he’s a wanted criminal he’1l
regret having put up all these
billboards.

(TURNS) Mel, you’re fired.
PRINCESS
OPAL
No. It comes from a talking doll.


She holds up a tarot card that looks exactly like Gabbo in
"tarot" style. It’s called "The Dummy."


KRUSTY
Hm. Well, I got a lotta money riding
on the Rams this weekend. How does

anything...
Gabbo jumps off Crandall’s lap.

Gabbo does the "Hully Gully," then speaks:

MILHOUSE
This is boring.
NELSON
I wonder what would happen if you put
your train on there.
Bart looks at the instructions.
BART
It says here, don’t.
Nelson shakes his fist in Bart’s face.
NELSON
It says here, do!


Bart puts his locomotive on the racetrack. After a beat it
starts to melt.

We see the Krusty show. SCENE 7
Krusty is sitting with an old rickety dummy named ALPHONSE.
He is wearing a huge moustache that completely covers his
mouth.
KRUSTY
So you want ventriloquism, do ya?
Alright watch this. (TO DUMMY) Hello
Alphonse, I’ve got a riddle for you.
Why is a raven like a writing desk?
ALPHONSE

Alphonse’s jaw suddenly falls in, making him look
grotesque. The kids SCREAM in terror.


KRUSTY
Hey, the dummy can’t hurt you. He’s
not even alive. He’s dead!
Krusty KNOCKS on the dummy’ s head to show it’s made of
wood. The head caves in, and the dummy’s arms spring off
and CLATTER to the floor. The kids SCREAM even louder.

Europe’s favorite cat and mouse team:
Worker & Parasite!
We see a title card in some indecipherable foreign
language. Then we see an arty cartoon with moving paper
cutouts of a CAT and MOUSE. They move around aimlessly,
CHATTERING
in weirdly pitched voices. First we see them in
a factory, then standing in a food line, then struggling
through a large mass of black squiggles. Suddenly the
cartoon ends. A black title card says: "Endut! Hoch
Hech!"

C) We see a Graumann’s Chinese type theater. One cement
block reads: "To Sid, Friends for Life, Krusty." Below
this are Krusty’s hand and foot prints. A workman pours
wet cement over it. Gabbo puts his hands and feet in the
new cement, as the crowd APPLAUDS.

KRUSTY
Yeah.
Lisa is looking at some framed photos on the wall. One has

Krusty looking on.

Bart looks at photos on the wall: Krusty SCENE 14
in a toga with ELIZABETH TAYLOR as Cleopatra; Krusty, very
drunk, in a hot tub with HUGH HEFNER surrounded by PLAYBOY
BUNNIES.
BART
Wow! Elizabeth Taylor... Hugh

KRUSTY

LISA
Hey Bart, If we get all of these big
stars to appear on a special with
Krusty, it might get his career going
again.
Krusty tosses his address book at Bart and Lisa.
KRUSTY

Here’s my address book. Go get those

Bart and Lisa run out. Krusty raises his fists in triumph.

A billboard reads "LITTER REMOVAL NEXT TWO MILES COURTESY
OF BETTE
MIDLER." Bart and Lisa are standing next to Bette
Midler, who is picking up trash along the highway with a
long pointed stick.
LISA
I think there’s a cigarette butt on
the center divider.
Bette Midler runs out into traffic to pick it up. She is
nearly run over by a truck, but she spears it with her
stick and returns.
BETTE
MIDLER
Got it.
BART
You could have been killed!
BETTE
MIDLER
(SIGHS HAPPILY) We’re Americans. We


deserve clean highways.


TWO YOUNG MEN
drive past in a pick-up truck. They throw a
beer can out the window.


BETTE MIDLER
(CONT’D)
You pigs!
She picks up the can and runs after the truck. She grabs
onto the rear view mirror and pulls up to the cab.
JAILBIRD
is driving.
JAILBIRD
Oh nooo! Bette Midler.


She throws the can back at them, then heads back to Bart

BETTE

LISA
We were asking you to appear on
Krusty’s come back special.

BETTE
MIDLER
(ANGRILY) No! I wanted to be Tina
Ballerina, forever. And he took that
away from me.

BART
Krusty didn’t know what he was doing.
That was the year he was hooked on
that muscle relaxant.

LISA
Yeah. Remember he gave all his money
to Reverend Ike?

BETTE
MIDLER
(THINKS) Okay. Tell Krusty he can
count me in.


A coke can is tossed out of another pick-up truck and rolls
up to Bette Midler’s feet. She picks it up.


BETTE MIDLER
(CONT’D)
(GRIM) It’s time to take out the
trash.


She throws the can at the speeding truck. It flies into
the cab. The truck goes out of control.

HUGH

A lot of people know about the grotto
and the game room...
BART
Of course.
HUGH

But few know about the laboratory,
the biosphere, the alternative energy
research center...


Bart looks in the laboratory and sees PLAYBOY BUNNY
SCIENTISTS
hard at work.


BART
Fascinating.
They walk on. Bart fills his pipe (REFILLING NOISE). Bart


looks out the window at a large gray structure on the

Hey, Red Hot Chili Peppers. Would

Oh, wait. That was the old sofa.

Simpsons’ living room and doing head rotations. Marge’s
hair KNOCKS items off shelves, the CAT dodges her with a
YOWL, etc.
C) Krusty tries to HIT Homer in the face with a pie. Homer
is open mouthed. Krusty misses and throws the pie in the
garbage. Homer looks very disappointed.
KRUSTY
(MOANS) I’1l never get my aim back.
BART
You’ve got to keep working on it.
Bart takes a hot pie out of the oven. Krusty HITS Homer
with it. Homer SCREAMS, then makes delighted CHEWING
NOISES.
HOMER
Mmm, delicious.

No, Krusty. You always treated me

you poured liquid nitrogen down my
pants and cracked my buttocks with a
hammer.
KRUSTY
Come on, you wanna waste your life
hanging out with a bunch of dorky
teenagers?
A teenaged COUNTER BOY approaches Krusty.

THE CALL OF THE
SIMPSONS
by
John Swartzwelder
ACT
ONE
FADE
IN:
EXT. SIMPSON'S FRONT YARD - SATURDAY MORNING
Open on HOMER watering the flowers HUMMING cheerfully while
BART
struggles to mow the lawn with an old-fashioned push-
mower.
BART
(GRUNTS WITH EXERTION) Oh man. Rusty
old hunk of junk.
Bart jerks his head toward the Flanders' house next door.
NEW
ANGLE
ROD
FLANDERS, the Flanders' 12-year-old son, is riding a
great-looking lawn tractor. He is reclining in his seat
under an umbrella, sipping a tall soft drink through a
straw. He sees Bart and waves.
ROD
(VERY FRIENDLY) Howdy, Bart. Hot
enough for ya?
BART
(GRUMBLING TO HIMSELF) Shut up,
Flanders. Hey Dad how come we can't
get a decent mower like the Flanders


have?


Final delivery 9/23/89 Page 2.


HOMER
Just be happy with what you got, son.
Don't try to keep up with the Flanders.
NED
FLANDERS, their neighbor, pulls into his driveway in a
gigantic RV labeled "The Land Behemoth." Ned sounds the
HORN.
It plays the first eight notes of the Colonel Bogey
March. Homer and Bart walk over to the RV, looking at it
enviously.
HOMER
(GASPS)
NED
(LAUGHS) How do you like my new
wheels, Simpson?
BART
(UNRESERVEDLY) Oh, wow, man!
HOMER
Bart! (TO FLANDERS) I suppose it
has... uh... various features?
NED
Oh, it's got everything! Microwave,
dishwasher, big-screen TV, deep fryer,
and... Oh, see up there on the roof?
Ned points to the satellite dish mounted on the roof.
HOMER
(CROAKING) A satellite dish!
NED
Yes indeedilly-doodily.


Final delivery 9/23/89 Page 3.


HOMER
But how can you afford something like
this, Ned? I get your mail once ina
while... you make only twenty-seven
dollars a week more than I do.
NED
Oh, it's simple, Simpson. Credit
HOMER
Oooh! Credit.
EXT. BOB'S RV ROUNDUP
(FORMERLY RVS R US) - A LITTLE LATER
Homer, Marge and the kids are standing in the middle of
dozens of spectacular RVs. Above them is a large banner
that says "We'd Rather Make A Friend... Than a Profit."
There is a drawing of a happy face after the word "friend"
and a frown after the word "profit." A smiling SALESMAN
BOB, wearing a cowboy hat, sees them and approaches.
DISSOLVE
TO:
BOB
Thank you, God. Heh, heh. (CLEARS
THROAT) May I help you?
MARGE
(QUICKLY) We're just browsing, thank
you.
HOMER
I'd like to see your finest RV. Do you
have something that's better than the


Land Behemoth?


The salesman looks through the sheaf of papers on his
clipboard.


Final delivery 9/23/89 Page 4.


BOB
Yes, we do. That would be... the
Ultimate Behemoth.
HOMER
(EXCITED) Where is it?
The salesman sweeps his arm in a grand gesture.
BOB


We are standing in its presence.


Behold!
BART
Oh... oh... Wow, man!
BOB


Man built this. It's a vehicle.
NEW
ANGLE
The family suddenly notices that they are standing next to
the biggest, most astounding RV in existence. The side of
it looks like the wall of a building. There are six sets
of wheels supporting it, and it looks like it could never
possibly turn on a regular city street.
HOMER
(BABBLES SPEECHLESSLY)
BART
Does it have its own satellite dish,
sir?
BOB
You can tell your son, it has its own
satellite. The VanStar One launched
last February, just for this thing.


That's all.


Final delivery 9/23/89 Page 5.


BART
Oh man!
MARGE
I'm not sure we can afford...
HOMER
(EAGERLY) Does it have a deep fryer?
BOB
It has four of them. One for each part
of the chicken.
MARGE
I don't think we can afford this,
Homer.
BOB
Let's worry about that later. Come on,
let's take a tour of it, want to? Come
on.
INT. INSIDE THE LAND BEHEMOTH SR. - CONTINUES
The family has reached the top of the Ultimate Behemoth's
escalator and is stepping off into the RV's entry hall.
They look around in amazement. There are plush chairs, and
a dining room with a huge chandelier. The dashboard looks
like the instrument panel on a 767.
HOMER
(BABBLES IN AWE)
MARGE
(MURMURS WORRIEDLY)


Homer presses the HORN. It PLAYS the first few bars of
ALSO SPRACH
ZARATHUSTRA.


BART
(IMPRESSED) Aye carumba!


Final delivery 9/23/89 Page 6.


LISA
This is better than our house!
HOMER
Wait till Flanders gets a load of this.
MARGE
(WORRIED) It all seems so expensive...
HOMER
How much is it?
BOB
Ah, you're a man of your convictions.
You just wanted to ask that and just
blurted it out, didn't you?
HOMER
Yeah. How much is it?
BOB
Well, first of all, I want you to know,
I like your face.
BART
(INCREDULOUS) You do?
BOB
I really do! I'm not just saying that.
I mean it. You've got color in there.
You're not Roman are you?
HOMER


No.


Final delivery 9/23/89 Page 7.


BOB

Look like a God, sort of. Why don't we

step into the credit office, Zeus?

(CHUCKLING) Hey, your Dad's gonna just

go in here, work it out and then you'll

drive home in this.
Bob leads Homer into the credit office.
INT. INSIDE CREDIT OFFICE - A FEW MINUTES LATER
The salesman is typing credit information into a computer.
Homer is watching him hopefully. There are friendly signs
plastered all over the office that say, "We give credit to
Everyone," "Bad credit? Good!," "Repossession?
Foreclosure? Ha-Ha!," "Bankruptcy Schmankruptcy."

BOB

I'm not gonna quote you a price until I

check your credit rating. Lemme. I

want to make myself clear on this.

This is a formality. If you're saying

to me, Bob, is this guy good for it? I

say, yes. I don't check this machine.

But I don't own the place. Even though

my name's up there. Long story. But

that doesn't matter. I'm gonna have to

run it through the computer.
Bob presses "enter" on the computer.
CLOSEUP - COMPUTER
TERMINAL


The red light on top of the computer begins flashing
“Warning, Warning." A warbling SIREN GOES OFF.


HOMER


Is that a good siren? Am I approved?


Final delivery 9/23/89 Page 8.


BOB
Have you ever known a siren to be good?
No, Mr. Simpson, it's not. It's a bad
siren. That's the computer in case I
went blind telling me, "Sell a vehicle
to this fellow and you're out of
business." That's what the siren says.
It seems the Ultimate Behemouth is a
wee bit out of your price range and wee
bit is me being polite. You couldn't
afford this thing if you lived to be a
million.
HOMER
Don't you have something that isn't out
of my price range? (SADLY) I don't
want to go away empty-handed, Bob.
BOB
Take it easy there. Don't ruin this
feeling I'm getting from you. Perhaps
I can show you something a little
more... you.
EXT. BACK OF THE RV LOT ~ A COUPLE OF MINUTES LATER
Parked as far away from the other vans as possible is "The
'Lil Land Turtle." Its windshield wipers are bent, there
are taped-up cracks in all the windows, the sides are
dented, and a pool of oil grows underneath the engine. The
salesman stands next to it proudly. The family is stunned.


Bart leans inside and HONKS the horn, which emits a
MOURNFUL
and STRANGLED version of "La Cucaracha."


Final delivery 9/23/89 Page 9.


BOB
Well, what do you think?

BART
Ah, you gotta be kidding me.

MARGE
It's used, isn't it?

BOB
What'd you say?

HOMER
Is it used?

BOB
Simpson, you're never going to own a
better RV. And I don't mean that ina
good way. I mean, literally, Buddy,
this is it for you. You know it's this
or a wagon.

HOMER
How much do you want for it?

BOB
This is yours? The price I'm quoting
you? You're not gonna hand it to
someone else? 'Cause I'm gonna give
you a price for you, not for someone
else... someone else, I'm doubling
this.

HOMER


I swear it, Bob.


Final delivery 9/23/89 Page 10.


BOB
This is you and me?
HOMER
Yeah!
BOB
In other words, two months from now I
see this vehicle, your head's in that
window?
HOMER
On my honor.
BOB
Three-fifty a month.
HOMER
Oh well, I don't know. Would it be all
right if I conferred with my family?
BOB
Mr. Simpson if you have to talk it over
with those humans out there, there's
something wrong with all of us. You
look like a man whose able to make
decisions or I wouldn't be wasting my
time. See that man right over there?
HOMER
Yeah!
BOB
He's buying this. Did you know that?


Final delivery 9/23/89 Page 11.


HOMER
No.

BOB
Called me two minutes before you came
in, said, 'Save the little one, I'm
coming down'. Here he is. Now, you
want it or not?

HOMER
All right. Al right! I'1l take it.

BOB
Best decision you're ever gonna make.
You're gonna... This is gonna change
your life. You know what you're gonna
do, first of all? You're gonna go
places you've never gone before. Have
you ever turned off the highway and
really gone into dangerous area? Over
big rocks, just missing large gullies?

HOMER


No.


Have fun!
DISSOLVE
TO:
EXT. THE SIMPSON'S DRIVEWAY - A LITTLE LATER
Marge and Lisa are staggering out of the house carrying
huge suitcases. The van is stuffed to the brim with


furniture. There are a number of boxes and chairs strapped
to the top. Bart is shoving the television in the back.


Final delivery 9/23/89 Page 12.


HOMER
Now remember, just bring the
necessities. We're going to be
roughing it.

MARGE
This isn't going to be like Mosquito
Lake?

HOMER
No, of course not. We'll bring
repellent this time.

MARGE
Well... okay. But I am not going to
clean any fish.

NEW ANGLE
;


Ned Flanders comes out of his house and stares with
disbelief at the van. Homer waves.


HOMER
Hey, Flanders! Look what I got!

NED
(TRYING TO BE NICE) (WHISTLE) Holy...
She's a beaut. Hey, congratulations,
Simpson. I'm sure you'll have loads of
fun.

HOMER
(LAUGHING) (LOW TO MARGE) Jealous.
(THEN) Everybody ready?


Everyone AD LIBS halfheartedly - "Yeah, I guess!" "Let's
get it over with," etc.


Final delivery 9/23/89 Page 13.


HOMER
(CONT'D)
That's the spirit. Ready or not
nature, here we come!


Homer GUNS the engine, shifts it into gear, and slowly
backs the van out of the driveway. A quart of oil blows on
the ground. The van is so overloaded it only has about one
inch of ground clearance and keeps SCRAPING BOTTOM and
shooting sparks as it gets out on to the street.


INT. SIMPSON
HOUSE


There is nothing left in the house except the kitchen sink,
which has ben half-pulled loose from its moorings.

SNOWBALL II
is sitting nonplussed in the center of the bare
living room. We hear 0.S. BARKING as SANTA'S LITTLE HELPER
enters the living room and starts chasing the cat around
the house.


EXT. FREEWAY - TEN MINUTES LATER

Traffic is backed up for miles behind Homer's slow-moving
van. SFX: "LA CUCARACHA" HORN. The van turns off the
highway onto a bumpy dirty road.

EXT. A NARROW DIRT ROAD - DEEP IN WOODS - AN HOUR LATER
The van is speeding down a narrow dirt road, breaking off
low branches. The chairs and boxes on top of the van are
shifting dangerously from side to side.

INT. VAN -
CONTINUOUS


Marge is trying to locate their position on a large road
map.

Skunks?

LISA


No.

Slaughter house?
LISA
No.
MARGE
What are you doing back there?
LISA


We're playing, what's that odor?


BART
Dad's feet.

HOMER
Bart!

LISA
You win, Bart.

HOMER
Lisa!

BART


Are we there yet, Dad?

HOMER
I'll tell you when we get there. Go
back to your smell game.

MARGE
(SHOWING HIM MAP) Homer, I'm telling
you this is not the Interstate.

HOMER


(SCOFFING) Pfft. Maps. (SNORTS)


Final delivery 9/23/89 Page 15.


MARGE
Shouldn't we stop somewhere and ask for
directions?
HOMER
(SNORTS) Directions! I don't need to
ask anybody for directions. All I need
is my trusty dashboard compass.
CLOSEUP - DASHBOARD
COMPASS
It is spinning in circles.
EXT. VAN -
CONTINUOUS
The van is climbing slowly up and over a series of huge
boulders. It nearly tips over, then rights itself and goes
on to the next boulder.
INT. VAN -
CONTINUOUS
MARGE
Homer! What on earth are you doing?
HOMER
Don't worry. This is an all-terrain
vehicle.
EXT. VAN -
CONTINUOUS
The van goes over the last boulder, heads straight down a
river bank and plows into a narrow, but swift river. The
van stays upright and seems to be getting across all right,
but it floats a little ways downstream before it manages to
get to the other side.

Oh, come on. We're getting back to
nature.
LISA
Mom, I'm scared.
MARGE
We all are, dear, but your father says
there's nothing to worry about.
EXT. OVERHEAD SHOT OF VAN - CONTINUOUS
The van is hurtling at fifty miles per hour through the
woods towards a cliff. It is a sheer drop of several
hundred feet to the gorge below.
INT. VAN -
CONTINUOUS


Homer is WHISTLING and admiring the scenery around him.
His foot is pressing the gas pedal to the floor.


HOMER
What do you think? Should we stop
here?


Everyone looks out the side window at the blurred passing
trees.


MARGE/BART/LISA
(FRANTIC SCREAM) Yes!!!
HOMER
All righty.
Homer puts on the brakes.
EXT. VAN -
CONTINUOUS
The van -- all four wheels locked -- slides across a


clearing and skids to a stop with half the chassis hanging
over the edge of the cliff.

INT. VAN
= CONTINUOUS
HOMER
Well, here we are!
Homer turns off the engine, opens his door, and puts one
foot out. The second he shifts his weight, the front door
of the van tips down dramatically. We can see the gorge
below through the windshield.
HOMER
Uh oh oh.
EXT. VAN -
CONTINUOUS


The van is slowly tipping back and forth like a teeter
totter.


ALL
(V.0.)
(HORRIBLE SCREAM) Aaaaaahhhhhh!!!!!
HOMER
Okay. Nobody move. Nobody panic.
When I give the word, everyone ever so
slowly open your door and slide out.
On the count of three. One, nobody
panic. Okay,
There are three immediate DOOR SLAMS and the whole family
is out of the van. The van shudders and teeters a little
more, than steadies itself.
HOMER
Nobody panic. Okay, now here's what
we're going to do. We'll shift our
cargo to the back of the van. (GASPS)
Keep away from there, Maggie... No!


MAGGIE'S

It falls, hits the ground, rolls over twice, then is shaken
repeatedly by several internal EXPLOSIONS.


BACK TO THE

They are standing near the edge of the cliff, peering over
and wincing as a few more EXPLOSIONS rip the van.

IN:
EXT. NEAR THE EDGE OF CLIFF - CONTINUOUS
A dense pillar of black smoke is rising up from the bottom
of the gorge. The family is looking at Homer. He is
trying to look at the bright side.
HOMER
Well, heh heh, now we get a chance to


be real pioneers.


No one speaks. Lisa shivers a little as a sudden cold gust
of wind gets under light coat. Maggie WHIMPERS.


HOMER
Yes sir! This is a real adventure.
Why, I bet there are people who would
trade everything they have in the world
for an adventure like this.
BART
You mean like we just did?
Maggie SNIFFLES.
HOMER
(RE MAGGIE) Will somebody help her?
LIDS
Look, Maggie! Birdies!


Lisa points up at a couple of vultures who are circling
overhead.


Final delivery 9/23/89 Page 20.


MARGE
Oh, Homer. What are we going to do?
HOMER
Now don't worry. Our situation isn't
as bad as it seems. And you're
forgetting I'm an experienced woodsman.
Now, you all stay here for a minute
while I go over this way and try to get
my bearings.
CAMERA TRACKS WITH
HOMER


as he walks round behind a clump of trees at the edge of
the gorge. He sits down and buries his face in his hands.

EXT. THE GIRLS' SHELTER - EARLY EVENING
Marge and the kids are watching as Homer puts the final
touches on a shelter he has built. It is really nothing
more than a small, uninviting pile of wet branches.
HOMER
(TRIUMPHANT) There! Finished.
LISA
You are?
HOMER
Well, it's a quick job, but it's
shelter.
MARGE
It is?
HOMER
Uh-huh. Okay, we'll be back with help
before you know it. You girls just
stay here and relax.
Bart and Homer begin walking off into the woods.
LISA
(CALLING AFTER THEM) Remember, Dad.
The handle of the Big Dipper points to
the North Star.
HOMER
(CHUCKLING) That's nice, Lisa, but
we're not in astronomy class. We're in


the woods.


Final delivery 9/23/89 Page 22.


As Bart and Homer hike OUT OF FRAME, Marge and Lisa examine
the shelter. They both make a face, and MURMUR in dismay.
Maggie totters off after Homer and Bart, making good time
despite frequent bellyflops. Marge has begun using a small
branch to sweep up leaves. Lisa looks up and sees Maggie
disappearing after the guys.
LISA
Should Maggie be going with them, Mom?
MARGE
Oh, I don't think they'll be gone long
and she's in good hands, Lisa.
NEW ANGLE - THE TWO VULTURES CIRCLING OVERHEAD
They have to make a decision. They look down at the women
cleaning the campsite, then at the men staggering through
the undergrowth. After a pause they start flapping after
the men.
BART AND
HOMER
are walking deeper into the woods, looking apprehensively
around them. Homer is only a little nervous. Bart is
starting to get spooked.
BART
(NERVOUS) There aren't any dangerous
animals in this forest are there, Dad?
HOMER
Well, might be a few. But don't worry
about it. If you leave them alone,
they'll leave you alone.
BART


It's a deal.

Animals can smell fear. And they don't

(PANIC) A rattler!

Bart and Homer crash wildly through the forest at full
speed. Camera PANS DOWN to Maggie. She SUCKS, takes one
or two faltering steps after them, turns around and begins
heading back to camp.

MAGGIE
as she totters up to a hollow log. She crawls into it, and
begins working her way through. The log turns a little
before she reaches the other end, so that when she climbs

EXT. THE GIRLS' CAMPSITE - CONTINUOUS
Marge and Lisa have made Homer's shelter much better.
Marge is busily tidying up the “yard" with a jury-rigged
broom and moving remarkably docile animals to more
decorative locations in the clearing. We see her patiently
lining up chipmunks on a log. The animals fidget and
blink, but remain where she puts then.
MARGE

(HUMS TO HERSELF) (PAUSE) The boys

certainly are taking a long time. I

hope Maggie isn't slowing them up too

much.

Maggie is standing in the center of a huge shadow looking
up.

There is a mammoth BEAR rearing up over Maggie. It is
GROWLING

SUCKS
and reaches a hand into her secret pacifier stash.
She pulls one out and shoves it into the bear's mouth as it
lurches at her.

Homer's head appears in the pool at the base of the falls.
He swims, COUGHING AND GASPING.

INT. BEAR CAVE -
CONTINUOUS
Three large bears are gnawing on salmon in the center of
the cave. Maggie's bear enters the cave carrying Maggie in
his teeth. (by her nightie). Maggie is gently set down on
the floor. The other bears gather around her menacingly.
Maggie's bear explains everything with a few GRUNTS AND
SNORTS.
The bears relax. They lumber off a few paces and
have a brief GRUNTING conference. One of them drags over a
large salmon and sets it in front of Maggie. Maggie
doesn't know what to do with it. She stares at it, looks
up at the bears, and SUCKS. The bears exchange concerned
looks.
EXT. SOMEWHERE IN WOODS
=- A LITTLE LATER
Bart and Homer are standing behind some bushes.
HOMER
The first thing you learn about
surviving in the woods, boy! Conceal
your nakedness.
BART
Yeah, man.
HOMER
Okay. Slap a fern on there, Boy. Now
for some mud. There. That requires a
little mollusk. And some mollusk for
me. All right. We're ready to hit the
town.


They step out from behind the bushes, wearing ferns and mud
and strategically placed mollusks, instead of clothes.


BART
But, Dad. I'm so hungry. Can't we eat
something first. I'm starving, man.
HOMER


Ah, food. Good thinking, son.

Homer looks around the clearing until he spots a small
tree.


HOMER
This young sapling ought to do the
trick.
Homer bends the top of the tree down near the ground, ties
the top of the tree down with a piece of vine, then forms
the rest of the vine into a small loop.
BART
What are we going to do, hang
ourselves?
HOMER
No. This is a trap. It's going to
catch us our dinner. Come on, boy.


Homer and Bart squat behind a bush. In the center of the
loop Homer places an appetizing-looking leaf.


HOMER
Shhhh! (WHISPER) Just watch.
They stare silently for a moment, then -- sure enough -- a
rabbit hops cautiously out of the woods, steps into the
loop, and starts to nibble on the leaf.
HOMER
(TRIUMPHANT WHISPER) Ha! Hal! Got
him!
The rabbit triggers the trap.

Homer walks into the bushes and, after the briefest of
pauses, we HEAR many rapid little SNICKS OF TEETH CLOSING
ON FLESH.
Homer lets out a YELL and reels out of the
bushes with rabbits, squirrels, ducks and snakes hanging
off him by their teeth.

A couple of dozen bees are swirling around the hive.
HOMER

Honey! Honey! We're saved!
BART
Ah, Homer, bees!
Taking no precautions whatsoever, Homer stuffs his hand
into the center of the hive and pulls out a handful of
honey that still has several bees on it. He shoves the
whole mess in his mouth. As Bart watches hungrily, Homer
rolls the honey around in his mouth and swallows it.

How is it?

(A FEW BEES FLYING OUT OF HIS MOUTH)
Tangy.
Homer is stung repeatedly in the mouth by several bees. We
can see his cheeks changing shape violently as the bees
inside his mouth repeatedly back up and slam into his
tongue. Homer's look of ecstasy fades and is replaced by


one of bewilderment, and then horror. He opens his mouth.

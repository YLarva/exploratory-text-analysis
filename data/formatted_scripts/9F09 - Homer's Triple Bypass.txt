EXT. SUBURBAN HOUSE -
NIGHT
CHIEF WIGGUM
and several other COPS stand outside.
WIGGUM
All right, boys, time to bag us a
cattle rustler.


He gestures and a tank with a battering ram BANGS down the
door. REVEREND LOVEJOY runs out.


REVEREND
LOVEJOY
What in God’s name are you doing?
WIGGUM
(CONFUSED) Isn’t this 742 Evergreen
Terrace?
REVEREND
LOVEJOY
No, that’s next door.


He points next door. We see a house with cows roaming the
lawn. JAILBIRD PEELS out in his car.


JAILBIRD
Close but no donut, cops.


He ROARS off. Wiggum gets on his radio.

WIGGUM

This is "Papa Bear." Put out an A.P.B.
for a male suspect; driving a...
(THINKS) car of some sort; heading in
the direction of... you know, that
place that sells chili. Suspect is
hatless. Repeat, hatless.

INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT


HOMER
lies in bed, in his pajamas, eating a turkey
d@rumstick and watching TV.


HOMER
I can’t wait till they throw his
hatless butt in jail.
MARGE
enters in her bathrobe.
MARGE
(CONCERNED) You really shouldn’t eat
so much in bed.
ANGLE ON
BED
Besides the turkey drumstick, Homer also has pizza, a fondu
pot, a plate of spaghetti and a 64 ounce bottle labelled,
"DIET SODA".
BACK TO
SCENE
MARGE
(CONT’D)
It’s not good for your heart.
HOMER
My heart is just fine... (PAINED NOISE)
MARGE


Homie, what is it?

9F09 FINAL DELIVERY 6/18/92


HOMER
Just workin’ the turkey through.
(POUNDS CHEST, THEN HAPPY) There it
goes!


ON
TV


We see the cops sitting at a diner. A waitress is
totalling the bill.


WAITRESS
Let’s see... that’s six pieces of pie
and three Irish coffees. That’1l be
$15.95.
WIGGUM
(TEARING UP CHECK) You’re new here
aren’t you?
Wiggum stuffs the torn-up check it in her blouse pocket.
EXT. SIMPSON HOUSE - ESTABLISHING - DAY
INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
BART
takes a bite of cereal and quickly CHEWS it.
BART
Hey Lis, there was a big train wreck
last night. Wanna see the victims?
LISA
(SUSPICIOUS) Huh, okay.


Bart sticks out his tongue which is covered with chewed up
cereal.


LISA
(CONT’D)


Bart, that’s gross!


9F09 FINAL DELIVERY 6/18/92


BART
You’re right. Let’s bury them at sea.
With his spoon, Bart scrapes the cereal off his tongue into
Lisa’s bowl where it lands with a PLOP. Just as he does
this, Homer, dressed for work, enters the kitchen.
LISA
(SCREAMS) Daaad!
Homer clutches his chest and GASPS.
BART
What’s wrong?
HOMER
(PLEASANTLY) You know that feeling you
get when a thousand knives of fire are
stabbing you in the heart? I’ve got
that right now. (THEN) Ooh... bacon!


Homer starts shoveling bacon in his mouth. Marge enters
the kitchen.


MARGE
Homer, I prepared a special surprise
just for you.


Homer recovers his composure. He pictures what his
surprise could be.


HOMER’S FANTASY


The surprise is a huge, roast PIG with an apple in its
mouth. Homer pulls the apple out.


PIG
Psst! The best meat’s in the rump.


The pig winks.


9F09 FINAL DELIVERY 6/18/92


BACK TO
SCENE


Homer snaps out of it when Marge presents him with a bowl
of bland oatmeal topped with apple slices.


HOMER
What the hell is this?
MARGE
Nice healthy oatmeal.
HOMER
Ooh, oatmeal. What a delightful treat.
(TAKES THE BOWL, THEN LYING) Ugh,
there’s a bug in it.
Homer starts to pour it down the sink.
MARGE
No there isn’t.
HOMER
Trust me.
MARGE
I’m just trying to get you to eat
better.
Homer takes a mouthful and starts chewing.
HOMER
(SARCASTIC) Look, Marge, you’ve had
your little joke. Now feed your man.
He shovels bacon and eggs onto his plate and CHOWS down.
BART
Dad, there’s a bug on that.
HOMER


Eh.


9F09 FINAL DELIVERY 6/18/92


Homer eats it anyway.
INT.
HOMER’S CAR - LATER
Homer, driving to work, is stuck behind a slow moving truck
carrying a house labelled, "BIRTHPLACE OF EDGAR ALLAN POE".
He flashes his lights, then HONKS his horn.
HOMER
Come on, come on! National treasure,
my ass!
Homer repeatedly SLAMS into the truck. Wood CRACKS. A
weather vane falls off the house’s roof and bounces off
Homer’s hood.
INT. TRUCK
CAB
The MOLE MAN is driving.
MOLE
MAN
Oh dear.
The cab lurches forward. His glasses fall off and SHATTER.
MOLE MAN
(CONT’D)
Now, you’ve done it.


INT. HOMER
CAR


Homer GROWLS and repeatedly RAMS the rear of the truck.
Suddenly Homer hears something and pulls off the road.


EXT. GAS STATION -
DAY
HOMER
I keep hearing this horrible irregular
thumping noise.
THE ATTENDANT
listens carefully.
ATTENDANT
(WISE GUY VOICE) It’s your heart. And


I think it’s on its last thump.


6


9F09 FINAL DELIVERY 6/18/92


HOMER
Whew! I was afraid it was my
transmission.


Homer pulls away. A young gas station BOY comes over to
the attendant.


GAS STATION
BOY
Hey, where’s he goin’?
ATTENDANT
(FATHERLY) Billy, remember when that
tire blew out and we just couldn’t find
a way to save it?
BILLY
He’s goin’ to the tire yard?
ATTENDANT
You’re a dull boy, Billy.
EXT. NUCLEAR POWER PLANT - ESTABLISHING - DAY
INT. NUCLEAR POWER PLANT - BURNS’ OFFICE


BURNS
is in front of a bank of monitors with SMITHERS,
staring at one screen that shows Homer eating donuts.


BURNS
Eh, look at that pig stuffing his face
with donuts on my time. (TO MONITOR)
That’s right, keep eating. Little do
you know you’re drawing ever closer to
the poisoned donut. (CHUCKLES) There
is a poisoned one isn’t there,


Smithers?


7


9F09 FINAL DELIVERY 6/18/92


SMITHERS
Uh, no sir. I discussed this with our
lawyers. They consider it murder.
BURNS
Damn their oily hides.


Burns looks back at the monitor. Homer has crawled onto
the table and is asleep with his head on a donut box.


BURNS
(CONT’D)
Bring him to me!
INT. NUCLEAR POWER PLANT - BURNS’ OFFICE - LATER
Homer stands nervously in front of his boss. As an INSET,
we see Homer’s heart react to what he’s experiencing. The
heart continues to beat rapidly.
BURNS
(CONGENIAL) Relax, Simpson. I just
brought you in for a friendly, "Hello."
We see Homer’s heart rate relax.
BURNS
(CONT’D)
-- and, "Goodbye!" You’re fired!
Homer’s heart speeds up again.
BURNS
(CONT’D)
But wait, perhaps I’m being too hasty.
You are highly skilled...
The heart relaxes again.
BURNS
(CONT’D)
++. at goofing off!
Homer’s heart races again.
BURNS
(CONT’D)


And your indolence is inefficacious!


8


9F09 FINAL DELIVERY 6/18/92


Homer doesn’t know what this means, and his heart is not
sure how to respond.


BURNS
(CONT’D)
That means you’re terrible!
That’s the last straw -- Homer’s heart freaks out and turns
blue. Homer clutches his chest and falls to the floor.
Smithers kneels over hin.
SMITHERS
Mr. Burns, I think he’s dead.


Burns looks down. Unseen by him, HOMER’S SPIRIT starts to
emerge from his body.


BURNS
Oh dear. Send a ham to his widow.
HOMER’S SPIRIT
Mmm... ham.
Homer’s spirit goes back into his body. Homer’s eyes open.
SMITHERS
No, wait. He’s alive.
BURNS
Oh good. Cancel the ham.
HOMER
(ANNOYED GRUNT)
EXT. STREET -
DAY
We see an ambulance speeding toward the hospital.
INT.
AMBULANCE


The DRIVER turns to Homer, who lies in the back.


9F09 FINAL DELIVERY 6/18/92


DRIVER
Hey, my wife asked me to pick up some
cat food at the Kwik-E-Mart. You mind
if we stop?

HOMER
(WEAKLY) S’okay... get me... some
jerky.

EXT. ROAD - A LITTLE LATER


The ambulance waits as a deer crosses at a deer crossing
sign.


DRIVER
Wow, look at that! How do they know to
cross there?
INT. HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM
= DAY
Homer is wheeled into the Emergency Room, a very busy
Place. We see familiar characters with assorted


ailments...


The camera moves past JASPER, his beard caught in the
spokes of his bicycle.


Then we see SIDESHOW MEL stuck in a circus cannon. Krusty
is with him as a team of DOCTORS look on.


The doctors light the cannon’s fuse.
MEL
I’m telling you, it’s not going to
work.


The canon EXPLODES, and when the smoke clears, Mel is still
stuck.


MEL
(CONT’D)


See?


10


9F09 FINAL DELIVERY 6/18/92


KRUSTY
You know who I really feel sorry for...
Sideshow Phil. Mel’s standing on his
shoulders.


Homer passes by a frazzled INTERN who’s been on duty for a
hundred-fifty hours straight.


INTERN
Send that woman to x-ray... pump that
man’s stomach.
He looks woozy for a beat.
NURSE
Doctor, you’ve been up for four days.
I really think you should sleep.
INTERN
I like strawberry jam. Strawberry jam
is ever so good.
The camera moves on to find CHIEF WIGGUM. His jaw is
locked wide open. EDDIE stands next to him holding a
tremendous submarine sandwich.
EDDIE
Yeah, he was taking a bite and his jaw
locked.
LOU
Hey, look. I can fit my entire fist in
here.
He demonstrates by putting his fist in Wiggum’s mouth.
WIGGUM

LOU
What’s that, Chief?
WIGGUM

INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY


Marge sits at the table with PATTY and SELMA, clipping
coupons.


PATTY
Oooh, "Buy three tubes of Mr. Blister,
get one free."

The PHONE RINGS and Marge answers...

MARGE
(INTO THE PHONE) Hello?... Yes... Oh,
dear lord! (TO HER SISTERS - VERY
WORRIED) Homer’s in the hospital! They
think it’s his heart.


Marge runs out, terribly upset. After a beat...


SELMA
Oh, my God.

PATTY
What?

SELMA


Five cents off wax paper.
INT. EMERGENCY ROOM -
DAY
HIBBERT
Clear!


We see DR. HIBBERT shocking Homer with the defibrillator.
Homer gestures for another shock. Hibbert shocks Homer
again.


9F09 FINAL DELIVERY 6/18/92


HOMER
More.
Hibbert shocks him again. Homer gives him the "OK" sign.
HOMER
(CONT’D)
Thank you.


Hibbert starts to put the equipment away as Homer sits up.
Marge runs in and gives Homer a big hug.


MARGE
Oh, Homie, I was so frightened.
HOMER
Marge, my whole life flashed before my
eyes.
FLASHBACK
We see Homer’s life:
INT. HOSPITAL -
DAY
A YOUNGER GRAMPA
is looking through the maternity ward
window. PAN across a row of babies to see BABY HOMER in a
crib labelled "Simpson." He’s eating a slice of pizza.
GRAMPA
How'd he get that?!
The nurses shrug.
INT. CATHEDRAL -
NIGHT


TWELVE YEAR-OLD HOMER
is performing "O HOLY NIGHT" solo in
front of a boy’s choir. He has a beautiful voice.

Oh hear the angels’ voices/ Oh ni-ight
di-vine/


We see Grampa in the audience.

9F09 FINAL DELIVERY 6/18/92


GRAMPA
What a voice. Young Homer is going to
make me a millionaire.

Oh ni-ight, di- (VOICE CRACKS) vine.

just changed. (SINGS BADLY, LIKE HOMER)
Oh night, when Christ was born...
GRAMPA
Dagnabit!
INT. AIRPLANE -
DAY


Homer sits in a seat. PASSENGERS around him look on
happily.


PILOT
(V.0O.)
Folks, because of our eleven hour
delay, we’ll be handing out headsets so
that you may watch "Weekend at
Bernie‘s" for free.
HOMER
YEAH!
He leaps up in his seat and thrusts his fist in the air.
FLASHBACK ENDS - BACK TO SCENE
DR.
HIBBERT
Mr. Simpson, I’m afraid you’ve just had


a mild heart attack.


14


9F09 FINAL DELIVERY 6/18/92


HOMER
But I’m out of the woods now, right? I
mean, whatever doesn’t kill me can only
make me stronger.
DR.
HIBBERT
Oh no, quite the opposite. It’s made
you weak as a kitten. (CHUCKLES) Look!
Hibbert slaps Homer playfully.
HOMER
(WEAKLY) Hey, c’mon, quit it.
HIBBERT
Coochy coochy coo! (ETC.)
He continues to tousle Homer’s hair and pinch his cheeks.
HOMER
(WEAK) Stop. Please stop.
MARGE
(WORRIED MURMUR) Can’t you do
something for him?
DR.
HIBBERT
Well, we can’t fix his heart, but we
can tell you exactly how damaged it is.
HOMER
(IMPRESSED) What an age we live in!
INT.
HOSPITAL
We see Homer’s head behind a full body screen. On the


screen, Homer’s circulatory system is green and glowing.
Hibbert explains the procedure to Marge.


15


9F09 FINAL DELIVERY 6/18/92


DR.
HIBBERT
What you see here is the radioactive
dye we injected, flowing through your
husband’s circulatory system.
NURSE
(HOLDING A GLOWING SYRINGE) But doctor,
I haven’t injected the dye yet!
DR.
HIBBERT
(QUIETLY) Good lord.
Behind the screen, Homer smiles and waves.
HOMER
(CHEERFUL) Hi.
INT. HOSPITAL - TREADMILL ROOM - DAY


Dr. Hibbert, holding a clipboard, watches as Homer, with
electrodes taped to his chest, walks a treadmill.


HOMER

HOMER
Am I there yet?
DR.
HIBBERT

HIBBERT’S OFFICE


Hibbert sits at his desk. Marge and Homer sit on chairs in
front of him.


HIBBERT
Homer, I’m afraid you’1l have to
undergo a coronary by-pass operation.
HOMER
Say it in English, doc.
HIBBERT
You’re going to need open heart
surgery!
HOMER
Spare me your medical mumbo jumbo.
HIBBERT
We’re going to cut you open and tinker
with your ticker.
HOMER
Could you dumb it down a shade?
MARGE
(INTERJECTING) Doctor, we’ll do what
ever it takes to get my Homie well.
HIBBERT
Good. (SOMBER) Good. I must warn you
though, the procedure will cost you
upwards of 40,000 dollars.
HOMER


I’1l1 give you 500.


9F09 FINAL DELIVERY 6/18/92


MARGE
Homer!
HOMER
(OUT OF CORNER OF MOUTH) Marge, you've
got to haggle with these guys.
INT. SIMPSON CAR -
CONTINUOUS
Marge and Homer are driving home.
MARGE
I don’t know how we can afford this
operation.
HOMER
Don’t worry, Marge. America’s health
insurance system is second only to
Japan, Canada, Sweden, Great Britain...
well, all of Europe. But, you can
thank your lucky stars we don’t live in
Paraguay.
Marge breaks down CRYING.

Marge and Homer are in bed with their financial records
spread out in front of them.


HOMER
Okay, okay. We need forty-thousand
dollars. Now, how much do we have in
the checkbook?

MARGE
Seventy dollars.

HOMER
Hmm, have we deposited any forty-
thousand dollar checks that haven’t
cleared yet?

MARGE
No. Don’t you have health insurance at
work?

HOMER
Well actually, we gave it all up for a
pinball machine in the lounge.

9F09 FINAL DELIVERY 6/18/92


HOMER
Don’t worry, Marge. I’ve got it all
figured out. As soon as they’re done
with me, you fall down and pretend to
have a heart attack. And while they’re
operating on you, I’1l drive away.
(CHUCKLES)
MARGE
(WORRIED MURMUR)
Homer sees Marge looking very upset.
HOMER
(CONT’D)
What?
MARGE
I just can’t see how we’re going to get
through this.
A crafty look crosses Homer’s face.
HOMER
Don’t worry, Marge, my heart may be
bad, but I’ve still got...
He taps his head.
HOMER
(CONT’D)

A neon sign shows a Merry Widow holding a huge check. Her
legs dance crazily on her husband’s grave.


INT. INSURANCE COMPANY -
CONTINUOUS


An INSURANCE AGENT sits at his desk, filling out a
questionnaire. Homer is sitting in front of him.

9F09 FINAL DELIVERY 6/18/92


INSURANCE
AGENT
Now before we give you health
insurance, I have to ask you a few
questions.

HOMER
(UPSET) Questions? Questions? Oh
gee, my whole scheme down the...
(SMOOTHLY) I mean, ask away.

INSURANCE
AGENT
Oh good. (LOOKS AT FORM) Now, under
"Heart Attacks" you crossed out "3" and
wrote "0",

HOMER
Oh, I thought that said, "Brain
Hemorrhages."

INSURANCE
AGENT
Uh huh. And do you drink?

HOMER
I do enjoy a snifter of port at
Christmas.

INSURANCE
AGENT
All right. Here’s your policy.

Homer starts to pocket the policy.

HOMER
(CONT’D)

(SMUG) Now let me tell you something,


Mr. Sucker...I just...


21


9F09 FINAL DELIVERY 6/18/92


INSURANCE
AGENT
Hold on there, you still have to sign
it.

HOMER
oh.


Homer takes the pen, but as he leans over to sign, he has
another heart attack. He clutches his chest.


HOMER
(WITH DIFFICULTY) Must... sign...
policy...
Homer tries desperately to sign the dotted line, but the
Insurance Agent grabs for the policy. He and Homer have a
brief tug-of-war (ADLIBBING).
INSURANCE
AGENT
Sir, I’m sorry. I can’t let you do
that.
HOMER
(GASPING FOR BREATH) I made an "H".
INSURANCE
AGENT
No, that doesn’t count.
HOMER
Looks like an "xX."
The agent pulls the policy out of reach. Homer collapses.

Once again, a horizontal Homer is surrounded by Dr. Hibbert

HOMER
(DREAMILY) Oh doctor, I was ina
wonderful place filled with fire and
brimstone. And there were all these
guys in red pajamas sticking pitchforks
in my butt.
HIBBERT
Mr. Simpson, you must get that
operation as soon as possible.
HOMER
I can’t afford it. (RE:
DEFIBRILLATOR) Maybe I should buy one
of those machines.
INT. SPRINGFIELD CHURCH -
DAY
Homer sits in front of Reverend Lovejoy.
HOMER
Now, I know I haven’t been the best

HOMER
Uh... some dog could do the operation.
LISA
Operation? What are you talking about?
HOMER
Kids, I have something to tell you.
MARGE
Oh, Homie, I don’t know. This might
upset them.
BART
Nothing you say can upset us. We’re
the MTV generation.
LISA
We feel neither highs nor lows.
HOMER
Really? What’s it like?
LISA
Eh.
HOMER
Well, you kids are old enough to know
the truth and I’m not going to
sugarcoat it.

Uh, yeah.

Homer Simpson! Well, if that don’t put

A hand pulls back the curtain separating the hospital room.
NED FLANDERS
is in the other bed.


HOMER
Flanders? What are you doing here?
FLANDERS
Caught a burglar rifling through my
china hutch last night. Well sir, he
pulled a gun on me, and when I wrestled
him to the ground, I shot him.
HOMER
(BORED) Is this going anywhere?
FLANDERS,
So, anyway, now he needs a kidney.
I’ve got two, so, I decided to share
the wealth! What are you in for?
HOMER


I got a bad heart.

FLANDERS,
Ah, if I could give you my heart,
Homer, I would.

Shut up, Flanders.
There is a silent beat, then --
NICK
RIVIERA
(ENTERING) Hi, everybody! I’m Dr.
Nick Riviera -- if you find a cheaper
doctor, you’re at the veterinarian!
(LAUGHS) Mr. Simpson, tomorrow I’11 be
removing your jaw.
HOMER
Hey... I’m supposed to have a heart
bypass.
NICK
RIVIERA
Okay, but I know how to do the jaw one.
Homer points to a MAN behind Riviera.
HOMER
Who’s he?
NICK
RIVIERA
Uh, he’s from the medical board. He
just wants to make sure I don’t do what
I did two months ago. (CHEERY) Well,
see you in the operating place!

FLANDERS
Dear Lord, thank you for Ziggy comics,

Oldies", Volumes One, Two and Four.
Homer, in his own way, tries to pray, too.
HOMER
Dear Lord, I’m really scared about this
operation tomorrow. If something
happens, please look after Marge, and


make sure my kids grow up right.

HOMER
No Krusty, I’m glad you’re here. I
could really use a good laugh.
KRUSTY
Well, there’s nothing funny about what
you’re about to go through. I know,
I’m in the Zipper Club myself.


Krusty rips open his shirt to reveal a long scar running
down his chest.


Krusty happily lights up and PUFFS a cigarette.

I even picked out a new name for you --

heart for six whole minutes?
MARGE
(ANNOYED MURMUR) I don’t know if I like
you reading all those cardiology books.
LISA
No, Mom, it’s very reassuring. And
I’ve learned a great deal from this
cow’s heart I got at the butcher shop.


Lisa PLOPS down a cow’s heart on butcher paper. Marge

He quickly hands her to Marge.
HOMER
Now, Marge, if the unthinkable should
happen, you’re gonna be lonely...
MARGE
Oh Homie, I could never remarry...
HOMER
Darn right. And to make sure, I want

I think Billy Carter put it best when

he said, "*‘Tis nobler to be..." Oh,

Homer stares uncomfortably at the kids for a beat. Lisa
leans up to his ear and WHISPERS in.


HOMER

Bart, the saddest thing about this is
I won’t get to see you grow up,
because...
Homer stops. Lisa WHISPERS more in his ear.

I know you’re going to turn out great,
with or without your old man.
BART

But don’t worry, because you’ve got a

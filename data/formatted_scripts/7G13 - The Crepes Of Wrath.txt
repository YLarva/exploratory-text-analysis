BART
(CALLING OUT) Froggie, I'm home.
Bart starts up the stairs.
INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY -
CONTINUOUS
Bart sheds his backpack, hat and skateboard before entering
his bedroom. A mess has already overflowed out of his room
into the hallway.
INT. BART'S
BEDROOM
The bedroom is waist deep in everything Bart has ever
bought, worn or stolen: a complete and utter mess. There
is a gallon-sized jar on Bart's dresser which contains a
frog, water and a lilypad.
BART
Hi little fella. Got some nice juicy
flies for you.
INT. UPSTAIRS
HALLWAY
Homer is coming down the hallway.


HOMER

Homer falls backwards, tumbling down the stairs and landing
flat on his back. The Krusty doll lands right next to hin.

I like to play with you. I like to
Play with you. I like to play with
you.

HOMER

Homer makes GRUNTING sounds as he tries to get up off the
ground, but like an overturned turtle, he is helpless.

Homer is still lying in the hall. He is GRUNTING FEEBLY

Maggie hands Homer her pacifier.

MARGE
Bart, if you had cleaned up your room
when I asked you to, your father's
trick back would still be aligned, so
you pick up this mess right now.
Marge SLAMS the door as she exits. Bart starts throwing
everything he owns into the closet, working outward from
the closet door.
BART
(MUTTERING TO HIMSELF) Clumsy Homer...
Everything's always my fault... If he'd
just watch where he was going...
During the above, Bart has tossed a baseball bat, a hobby
horse, a microscope, and a parking meter into the closet.
He picks up a cigar box (H. Uppman Monarchs). As he is
about to toss it, he hears an intriguing RATTLE inside the
BART

Hello.
He SHAKES the box near his ear.
BART

saw that.

GLORIA
You certainly have done awfully well
for yourself, Spanky.

SKINNER
(PLEADING) Mother, please don't call
me Spanky on school grounds.


Bart is standing in the school yard surrounded by RICHARD,
LEWIS
and MILHOUSE. They are examining Bart's cherry bomb.


MILHOUSE

Wow! A cherry bomb!
LEWIS

What are you gonna do with it, Bart?

Principal Skinner and Gloria approach then.

MILHOUSE

Watch out, Bart. It's Skinner.
BART

Uh oh.


Bart hurriedly shoves the cherry bomb into his pants
pocket. The four boys smile insincerely.


BART/RICHARD/LEWIS/MILHOUSE

SKINNER
Mother, I would like you to meet,
Milhouse, Lewis, Richard, and... Bart
Simpson.
GLORIA
This is the Bart Simpson you're always

The doors to the boys and girls bathrooms are right next to
each other.


INT. BOYS
BATHROOM


There is a row of toilets in open stalls. Bart, Lewis,
Richard and Milhouse are standing by the sinks.


MILHOUSE
So you're gonna flush it?
BART
What can I say? I got a weakness for
the classics.
Bart takes out a lighter and lights it.
INT. SCHOOL
HALLWAY
Principal Skinner and Gloria are walking down the hall.
GLORIA
I think I need to make a stop in the
little girl's room.
SKINNER
Okay, Mother. This way.

mother. She goes inside.

Water is shot from each toilet like a CANNON, hitting the

We are CLOSE on Gloria's sensible black shoes inside the
stall. Suddenly they are rocketed upwards out of frame. A
beat later water CASCADES down.
INT.

The boys bathroom door BURSTS open with Bart leading his
friends out, running and GIGGLING. Bart runs smack into
Skinner and freezes, causing his friends to pile up behind

HOMER
Actually, I was wondering if you could
make me a grilled cheese sandwich.
MARGE
Well... okay.
HOMER
Make sure it's squished flat and
crunchy on the outside.
MARGE
I know how you like 'em, Homer.
Marge starts to exit.
HOMER

that come in a can. Oh, and some fruit
cocktail... in heavy syrup.

Marge opens the front door. Skinner is standing there
holding Bart by the ear.


SKINNER
Hello, Mrs. Simpson. I'm afraid
there's been a very disturbing incident
at school today.

BART
I'm outa here, man.


Skinner lets go of Bart, who goes running up to his room.
Marge and Skinner cross to the living room.


NEXT

MARGE
Homer, Principal Skinner's here.

HOMER
Oh, hello Principal Skinner. I'd get
up but the boy crippled me.

SKINNER
Mmm-hmmm. I understand completely.
The disturbing incident I was referring
to happened this morning, when your son
flushed an explosive device down the
boys lavatory.

HOMER
(CHUCKLING) That old gag.

SKINNER
Unfortunately, at the same moment, my
mother was in the girls lavatory making


use of the facilities.

MARGE
Oh, dear.

SKINNER
Can I say something my mother won't be
able to say for several months?

HOMER
Sure.

SKINNER
Can I sit down?

MARGE
Ewww.

Skinner sits down.

SKINNER
Mr. and Mrs. Simpson, we have
transcended incorrigible. I don't
think suspension or expulsion will do
the trick. I think it behooves us all
to consider... deportation.

MARGE
(AGHAST) Deportation! You mean kick
Bart out of the country?

HOMER


Hear him out, Marge.


FINAL DELIVERY
11/3/89 PAGE 12.


SKINNER
Well, perhaps I was being a tad glib.
Let me explain. Our elementary school
participates in a foreign exchange
program. Normally, a student is
selected on the basis of academic
excellence or intelligence, but in
Bart's case I'm prepared to make a big
exception. And, if you're willing to
play along, he can spend the next three
months studying far, far away..

HOMER
Sounds great, although a kid can't
learn much in just three months.

MARGE
Homer! You didn't even ask where Bart
would be going.

SKINNER
Actually, he'd be staying in France in
a lovely chateau in the heart of the
wine country.

Skinner takes out a picture of a beautiful chateau.
MARGE


But Bart doesn't speak French.


FINAL DELIVERY
11/3/89 PAGE 13.


SKINNER
Oh! When he's totally immersed in a
foreign language, the average child can
become fluent in weeks.
HOMER
Yeah, but what about Bart?
SKINNER
I'm sure he'll pick up enough to get
by. And, the whole thing won't cost
you a dime as long you're willing to
take in a student of your own.
HOMER
Wait a minute, Skinner. How do we know
some principal over in France isn't
pulling the same scam you are?
SKINNER
Well, for one thing, you wouldn't be
getting a French boy. You would be
getting an Albanian.
HOMER
You mean all white with pink eyes?
SKINNER
No, no, no, no. A student from
Albania. It's a country on the


Adriatic Sea.


FINAL DELIVERY
11/3/89 PAGE 14.


MARGE
Well I think going to France sounds
like a fantastic opportunity, but I
think Bart should have a say in this.
Marge gets up and leaves.
INT. BART'S
BEDROOM
Bart is talking to his frog, who is in the jar.
BART
Aaah, the life of a frog. That's the
life for me.
Marge enters.
MARGE
Bart, how would you like to spend the
next three months living in France?
Bart's eyes widen. He smiles.
BART
France?

BART
And I'd get to take a plane there,
wouldn't I, Mom?
MARGE
Yes, Bart.
BART
Wow. And one back?
MARGE
Mmm-hmm. Well, Bart seems very


enthusiastic about the idea.

Yes... yeah!

LISA
What do you know about France?
BART
I know I'm going and you're not.
Homer gets down on one knee.
HOMER
I'm gonna miss you, son. And listen...
while you're seeing all those great
sights, always remember that you're
representing your country. I guess
what I'm saying is, don't mess up
France the way you messed up your room.
BART
Okay, Dad.

We see a number of people holding up small signs with the
following names: BARDOT, BELMONDO, ROQUEFORT, PERRIER,
LINDBERGH.
Finally Bart sees a small sign reading "Bart
Simpson." It is held by a coarse, loutish, gap-toothed,
shifty-eyed young swine named UGOLIN. Bart rushes to hin.

seedy-looking Yves Montand type, CESAR, is talking to his
donkey, MAURICE.

SKINNER

You may find his accent peculiar.

Certain aspects of his culture may seem

absurd, perhaps even offensive. But I

urge you all to give little Adil the

only in this way, can we hope to better

understand our backward neighbors

throughout the world.

Thank you, Principal Skinner. Thank

you, fellow students. (BECOMING

Can I have something to go with my

When you work like a man, we will feed
you like one.
Ugolin points to a pile of straw on the floor in a corner.
UGOLIN
Now, go to sleep.
Bart shrugs and SIGHS. Before Bart can get to the straw,
Maurice the donkey crosses to the pile and lays down on top
of the straw. Bart tries pushing Maurice over.
BART


Hey! Hey! Come on. Move it, pal.

Ugh... maybe. Hold on a second.

his now full bucket. We PULL OUT to reveal that he has
picked the entire field.

He looks both ways and takes the final grape off the vine
and puts it in his mouth. Suddenly, Ugolin slaps him on

we give you shelter, and this is how

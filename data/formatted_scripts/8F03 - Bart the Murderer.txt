IN:
INT.
BART’S BEDROOM - MORNING


Bart is sleeping with a contented smile on his face. The
ALARM
goes off and he wakes up. He seems very cheerful.


BART
Good morning world!
He hops out of bed, stubbing his toe hard.
BART
(CONT’D)
ow!
He exits, still cheerful, WHISTLING and limping slightly.
INT. SIMPSON DINING
ROOM
Bart WHISTLES and limps into the dining room where Lisa is
eating a bowl of "Jackie-O’s" with a picture of Jackie
Onassis on the box. It reads: "Free stretch pants inside."
BART
Good morning Lisa!
LISA
What are you so happy about?
Bart goes to the cupboard and looks through the available
cereals as he speaks. He pulls out a box of Chocolate


Frosted Frosty Krusty Flakes, which has Krusty on the box
saying: "Only sugar has more sugar!"

BART
Why shouldn’t I be happy? It’s a
beautiful day, my homework is done,
I’ve got my mojo workin’ and we’re
going on a field trip this afternoon.
Bart sits down at the table and pours himself some cereal.
He looks at the front of the box and reads about the prize
inside.
BART
(CONT’D)
And... it looks like I’ve got me a
genuine glow-in-the-dark police
badge.
Bart digs his hand into the box and feels around, spilling
flakes over the top. After a moment some of his joy of
life fades.
BART
(CONT’D)
Hey! It’s not in here. You stole
it!
LISA
*
(WITH SCORN) No one wants your stupid
police badge, Bart.
Homer strolls in, adjusting his tie and police badge.
HOMER
Hey, look what I got. A genuine
official police badge... (OFFICIOUSLY)
Calling all cars... come out with
your hands up!


BART


Hey, that’s my badge Homer.

BART

(SCREAMS)


On the floor, Santa’s Little Helper is chewing up Bart’s
homework.


BART
You ate my homework?
Santa’s Little Helper wags his tail happily. He sure did!
BART
(CONT’D)
I didn’t know dogs really did that.


Santa’s Little Helper COUGHS up a piece of Bart’s homework.
It reads: "9 x 9 = 100."


EXT. BUS STOP - A FEW MINUTES LATER


Bart races up to the bus stop just as the doors close.

From the back of the bus Lisa waves smugly to Bart a la
"the French Connection" as the bus PULLS AWAY. Bart starts
walking to school. The sky clouds up immediately and it
starts RAINING buckets.


EXT. ROAD ON THE WAY TO SCHOOL

Bart is thoroughly drenched. His notebook swells to three
times its normal size. Several cars and a eighteen-wheel
truck ROAR past him, SPLASHING him with water.

EXT. SCHOOL GROUNDS - A HALF HOUR LATER

Bart finally gets to school. The second he enters the


school grounds the rain stops, the sky clears, and a
spectacular rainbow appears.

Bart SQUELCHES into his class and starts to sit down in his
seat.


MRS.
KRABAPPEL
Bart Simpson! You’re late! Go fill


out a tardy slip.


BART
But I’m only... (LOOKS UP AT

Bart SQUELCHES back out into the hall as the other kids
GIGGLE.


EXT. SCHOOL GROUNDS -
RECESS


Bart is showing off on the monkey bars for the benefit of a
bunch of girls.


BART
Hey girls! Look at me!
He does a "skin-the-cat" and his pants split wide open.
The girls explode into HIGH-PITCHED GIGGLES. Bart’s face
reddens and he quickly gets down from the monkey bars.
BART
(CONT’D)
You can stop looking at me now.
A kickball hits Bart in the eye. Bart walks away as fast as


he can holding his pants together with one hand and his eye
with the other.

INT. LUNCHROOM -
NOON
In a secluded portion of the entrance to the lunchroom -
unseen by lunchroom monitors - Nelson and his two goons are
holding up kids for their lunch money. He lets the cool
kids pass unmolested and stops the real nerdy kids by
blocking the door with his arn.
NELSON
(LOOKING OVER EACH KID BRIEFLY)...
Okay, you’re cool, you can go...


(SHARP) Hey! Wendell! Gimme your


lunch money... (FRIENDLY) How ya
doin?... (TO MARTIN)... Fork it over
wuss (LAUGHS)... go on through,


you’re all right...
Bart arrives at the front of the line. His left eye is
blackened. His nose is up in the air with a wad of toilet
paper in the left nostril to stop the bleeding. His butt is
hanging out of his pants. Water is leaking out of his
shoes. Nelson looks Bart over briefly.
NELSON
(CONT’D)
Gimme your lunch money.
BART
(OFFENDED) Hey, Nelson I thought we
were friends.
NELSON
(SINCERELY APOLOGETIC) Sorry Bart. I
never noticed what a geek you were.


Gimme your lunch money.


Bart thinks about this, nods sadly, hands over the money,
then turns and limps out of the lunchroon.

Well, it’s nearly one o’clock. And
you know what that means.
All the kids CHEER.
MRS. KRABAPPEL

INT.
SKINNER’S OFFICE
PULL BACK
to Bart sadly watching the kids leaving from
Principal Skinner’s office window. Skinner walks up behind
Bart.
SKINNER
(JOVIAL) Don’t worry, Bart, we’ll
find something fun for you to do.
Skinner notices a huge box of envelopes.
SKINNER
(CONT’D)
Ah! Here we are! Here’s a whole box
of unsealed envelopes for the PTA.
BART
(DOUBTFULLY) You’re making me lick
envelopes?
SKINNER
*
Oh, licking envelopes can be fun!
All you have to do is make a game of
it.
BART
(DUBIOUS) What kind of game?
SKINNER
*
Well... for example... you could see
how many you can lick in an hour, and


then try to break that record.


Ts


8F03 FINAL DELIVERY 4/5/91


BART
Sounds like a pretty crappy game to
me.

SKINNER
Yes... well... get started.


Bart takes an envelope out of the box and starts licking
it.


EXT. THE
“AH FUDGE!"' CHOCOLATE FACTORY IN SHELBYVILLE
The kids happily pile off the buses and enter the chocolate
factory. We see COCOA BEANIE, a smiling cocoa bean mascot
with a beanie on his head.
MILHOUSE
Oh my god. It’s Cocoa Beanie
himself.
LISA
*
(TO JANEY) I think this is something
Bart would really have enjoyed.
(SIGHS) But it’s the only way he’1ll
learn.
INT. CHOCOLATE FACTORY ORIENTATION
ROOM


The kids are being shown an orientation film. This film is
hosted by washed-up actor TROY MCCLURE.


8F03 FINAL DELIVERY 4/5/91


TROY
MCCLURE

Welcome to the chocolate factory.
I’m Troy McClure. You probably
remember me from such films as "The
Revenge of Abe Lincoln" and "The
Wackiest Covered Wagon in the West."
The history of chocolate starts with
the ancient Aztecs.

CLOSE UP OF
FILM


An AZTEC, resembling the Cleveland Indians logo, is holding
an Ah Fudge! chocolate bar.


TROY MCCLURE
(V.O. CONT’D)
In those days, instead of being
wrapped in a hygienic package,
chocolate was wrapped in a tobacco
leaf.


The chocolate bar turns into something closely resembling a
cigar.


TROY MCCLURE
(V.0. CONT’D)
And instead of being pure chocolate
like we have today, it was mixed with
shredded tobacco. And they didn’t
eat it. They smoked it.

The Aztec smokes the cigar and seems pleased.

INT.
SKINNER’S OFFICE


Skinner, who is doing some paperwork, looks up and smiles
amiably as Bart licks his 85th envelope.

SKINNER
You didn’t believe me when I said it
would be fun, did you?
BART
(TONGUE SWOLLEN) No thir.
Bart looks up at the clock. We see the second hand pause
for a very long time, then advance one, with a CLICK, then
pause for a very long time again, then goes backward one,
with a CLICK.
BART
(MOANS)
INT. CHOCOLATE FACTORY - CHOCOLATE ROOM
The kids are running uncontrollably around the main floor
of the factory, pulling levers, having tug of wars with
chocolate taffy, eating things they find on the floor, etc.
For some reason, one of the smallest kids is now naked.
The teachers are halfheartedly trying to keep the kids
under control.


KIDS


(ECSTATIC) Yayyyyyyyy!!


A number of kids, including Milhouse and Nelson are leaning
over the railing of a huge vat of chocolate. Milhouse
leans a little too far and his glasses fall in.


MILHOUSE
My glasses.
Several other kids lean over to see where the glasses went
and all kinds of junk falls out of their pockets into the
chocolate. A few kids dip their hands into the chocolate
and lick their fingers. Suddenly a kid surfaces from the
bottom of the vat.
EXECUTIVE
Please, kids, play sanitary.
The kids ignore him. In another part of the factory Cocoa


Beanie has fallen on his back and a kid is furiously
kicking him.

small bowl of hard candy on Skinner’s desk. He reaches for
a piece and his hand is SLAPPED by Skinner.

INT. CHOCOLATE FACTORY - CHOCOLATE ROOM = CONTINUOUS


Milhouse and Nelson are floating on their backs in the
middle of the vat.


MILHOUSE
Bart would have loved this.
NELSON
Man, you’re living in the past.
Bart’s not here and there’s nothing
we can do about it. We’ve got to get
on with our lives.
MILHOUSE
You’re right.
Nelson spouts chocolate out of his mouth.
INT.
SKINNER’S OFFICE - A LITTLE LATER
Bart finishes licking the last envelope. His tongue is
swollen and useless. We HEAR the sound of SANDPAPER
AGAINST WOOD.
The clock says one minute to three.
BART
Tan Die Doe Dow?
SKINNER
What?


Bart picks up a piece of paper and writes out "Can I go
now?"

Hmm... Well there’s still a minute to

tell your teacher I let you go home
early. Heh heh heh.

It immediately starts to RAIN BUCKETS again.

Bart is on his skateboard, not even trying to avoid being
splashed by the school buses that are passing by. The
skateboard goes out of control with Bart on it. Bart
TUMBLES

INT.
"THE LEGITIMATE BUSINESSMAN’S SOCIAL CLUB" —
CONTINUOUS


The club is dimly lit and dangerous looking. There are a
couple of card tables, a bar, a slot machine in the corner
etc. The wall behind the bar has pictures of MAYOR QUIMBY,
SINATRA, NIXON, HOFFA, and KRUSTY, all posing with
gangsters. There is also a very old picture of a gangster
posing with ROMMEL. Rommel looks nervous. One of the
gangsters, FAT TONY gets up and walks over to the MEN who
are pointing guns at Bart.
FAT
TONY
Hey, what’s with the kid?
Bart squirms.
BART
Hands off the material!

loose.

chain-smoking next to an old dirty wall phone.


Joey nods


FAT TONY

Hmm... "Don’t have a cow" in the

They all pull their guns on Bart, in the same shot that
ended Act I. He sees a stained, partially torn, cocktail
chart on the wall behind the bar. Bart nervously looks at


the directions for making a manhattan and quickly mixes
one. Legs tastes it.

gangster takes a drink, he stuffs some money in Bart’s
shirt. Bart looks at one gangster’s hand. He has four
aces and a king. Bart looks at another gangster’s hand:

he has five aces. Bart looks at Fat Tony’s hand: he has
six aces including the ace of stars and the ace of anchors.
On the table is a pile of discarded aces.


2) ‘INT. CLUB


The gangsters are reading the racing form. Through the

Homer is in bed. Marge enters in her nightgown.
MARGE
I know it’s good for a boy to have a
part time job, but I’m not sure about
the people Bart’s working for. Lisa
thinks they’re criminals.
HOMER
A job’s a job. I mean, take me. If
my plant pollutes the water and
poisons the town, by your logic that
would make me a criminal.
Marge goes to the window.
MARGE
Well, Bart‘’s been acting very
strangely. And that pizza delivery
truck has been parked across the

Homer falls asleep, SNORING. Marge MURMURS and looks out

a knife between each of his fingers into the table.
Another guy is playing jacks. We hear a clock TICKING.

his lips thoughtfully.
RIVAL GANG

What have I done to deserve this


flat, flavorless manhattan?


Fat Tony’s gang watches in horror as the Rival Gang Leader

Hm... perhaps we should go to meet
and greet this individual. Come on,

Fat Tony walks over to Legs, Louie and Joey and WHISPERS to

and exit. Bart does not see this. Bart pours himself a
shot of milk, drinks it in one GULP and SLAMS the shot
glass on the bar.

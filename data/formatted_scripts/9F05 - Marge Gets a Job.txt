Marge is sitting at the table with the mail. Homer is
lying on the couch.


MARGE
(READING MAIL) Resident...
occupant... smart shopper... Oooh!
They’re having a retirement party for
someone at the plant.
HOMER
I wish I could retire.
A thought bubble forms over his head.

A retired Homer is lying on the couch identical to the
present scene.

Ned Flanders passes by the window smoking a pipe. He is
strangely tilted and pipe smoke rises at a 45-degree angle.

NED
FLANDERS
Howdy-do, neighbor! Good pipe
weather. Thought I’d fire up the
briar.

HOMER
Can’t talk -- busy.
NED
FLANDERS
(CHIPPER) Okely-dokely-do.
He exits.
HOMER
Hey, Marge, did you notice how
slanted he looked?
MARGE
Maybe it’s the house.
As she speaks the mail slides off the table.
HOMER
There you go again. Ned Flanders


can’t be slanted; it must be our


house.


Homer tries to drink a beer but the liquid pours on his
forehead.


HOMER

INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
The family eats breakfast. Bart eyeballs his own stack of
pancakes, adjusting them for the slant, then pours the
syrup.
MARGE
Homer, I really think it’s time we
did something about the foundation.
HOMER
Marge, you’re such a pessimist. You
see the house as half sunk into the
ground; I see it as half sticking


out.


Maggie’s high chair starts SLIDING toward an ominous
turning floor fan. Lisa snags her just before she makes
contact.


LISA
Maybe we should call a repairman.
HOMER
Repairman? Now, Lisa, what do I
always tell you?
LISA
"All repairmen are crooks, all
lawyers are shysters and all doctors
are quacks."
HOMER
Egg-zackly.
INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - BASEMENT - DAY


Homer watches a video on how to fix foundations. Bart
stands by with Homer’s tool box.


9F05 TABLE DRAFT 4/21/92


ON SCREEN - TROY MCCLURE VIDEOTAPE - CONTINUOUS
Troy McClure is wearing painter’s pants and a tool belt.
MCCLURE
Hello, I’m Troy McClure. You might
remember me from such instructional
videos as "Mothballing Your
Battleship" and “Dig Your Own Grave -
and Save!" Over the next six hours
I’1l be taking you through the do’s
and do not do’s of foundation repair.
Ready?
HOMER
Ready!


Homer gets up and heads for the basemer= wall. Bart
follows.


MCCLURE
(0.S.)
First, patch the cracks in the slab
using a latex patching compound and a
patching trowel...
HOMER
Hand me my patching trowel, boy.
Bart opens the dusty toolbox. He pulls out the only tools
-- a hammer and a screwdriver, both still shrink-wrapped,
with a little card that says "To Homer. Happy 26th
Birthday. Love, Marge." Bart holds them out to Homer.
HOMER
(CONT’D)


Eh, I'll just use the cassette box.


Homer wields the cassette box as a trowel.

HOMER
(CONT’D)
Now what?
Homer AD LIBS through the following:
MCCLURE
Now, do you have extruded polyvinyl
foam insulation?
Homer looks around. He sees none.
MCCLURE
(CONT’D)
Good. Assemble the aluminum J-
channel using self-furring screws.
Install. (FAST) After applying
brushable coating to the panels,
you'll need some corrosion-resistant
metal stucco lath. If you c n/t find
metal stucco lath....
HOMER
(HOPEFUL) Uh huh?
MCCLURE
Use carbon-fiber stucco lath.
HOMER
(MOAN
MCCLURE
Now, parge the lath...
EXT. SIMPSON HOUSE - THE NEXT DAY
A truck, labeled "Surly Joe’s Foundation Repair" pulls up.
It has a logo of an irritable old coot wearing a Peterbilt


cap on it. A FAT CONTRACTOR, matching the picture on the
logo, gets out. Homer is waiting for him.


9F05 TABLE DRAFT 4+/21/92


HOMER
Hey, don’t I know you from somewhere?
CONTRACTOR
Yeah. I was here two years ago.
Remember, I told ya, you could pay a
few dollars then or through the nose
later on?
HOMER
Well, I gave it a lot of thought and
decided to pay through the nose.
INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - BASEMENT - A FEW SECONDS LATER


Homer and the contractor are walking down the stairs.
Homer points to the beams in the wall.


HOMER
The beams look sturdy enough
The contractor walks up to the wall. he peels back a loose
end of wallpaper, revealing that the beams were really just
wallpaper with a picture of beams on it. Behind the
wallpaper, we see the house is held up by a stack of old
"Playdudes".
CONTRACTOR
Old contractor’s trick. Your house
is actually resting on this stack of
magazines.
HOMER
(LOOKING AT PLAYDUDES) Ooooh! A


Barbi Benton pictorial.


Homer YANKS out a magazine and the house lurches.


9FO5 TABLE DRAFT 4/21/92


EXT. SIMPSON HOUSE -
CONTINUOUS

We see the whole house slant even more as it makes horrible
CREAKING, GRINDING, SHIFTING sounds. Bart flies out the
window with a SCREAM.

INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS


The contractor places a spirit level on the ledge to gauge
the problem. The level slides off and FALLS to the flcor.


HOMER
Did you see the bubble?
CONTRACTOR
I’m afraid the whole west side of the
house is sinking. I figure it’s
gonna cost you... sixty-five hundred.
HOMER
(SHOCKED) Forget it. You’re not the
only foundation guy in town!
INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - DEN - A FEW MOMENTS LATER
CLOSE UP
of yellow pages, under "Foundation Repair".
"Surly Joe’s Foundation Repair" is the only listing. The
ad features a glossy-looking picture of the contractor with
the headline: "The Only Foundation Repair Company in Town."
HOMER

missing. And speaking of
Italy... (FOOTAGE OF SIMPSON
HOUSE)...Leaning Tower of Pisa eat
your heart out and move over!
(CHUCKLES) This is one story that’s
not on the level!
ON SCREEN
we see footage of TOURISTS in front of the house,
leaning sideways as other tourists are LAUGHING and a
Japanese family takes photos.
EXT. SIMPSON HOUSE - A LITTLE LATER
A VENDOR
sells T-shirts that reads "I got bent at
Springfield’s Wacky Shack". Tourists take little pieces of
the house for souvenirs. One kid tears off a shutter.
Bart wears a top hat and acts like a carnival barker.
BART
Behold the horrors of the Slanty
Shanty. See the twisted creatures
that dwell within. Meet "Cue Ball,"
the man with no hair!
Bart points to the window where we can see Homer. Homer
sees what Bart is doing and GROWLS out the window. The
crowd GASPS in fear.
INT. SIMPSON HOUSE -
CONTINUOUS
MARGE
Homer, we have to do something... my


hair looks ridiculous.


PULL BACK
reveals Marge’s hair is tilted and droopy.


9FO5 TABLE DRAFT 4/21/92


HOMER
Marge, it’ll cost eighty-five hundred
dollars. We only have five hundred
in the bank. That leaves... 80
hundred we need.
MARGE
I could get a job.
HOMER’S THOUGHT BUBBLE - MONTAGE
Homer imagines Marge working:
a) Marge as a lady wrestler bouncing off ropes - GROWLING -
then running back and getting the lady opponent into a leg


lock and bringing her down.


b) Marge using a floor waxer on the floors of a gigantic
bus station very late at night.


c) Marge as a toll booth attendant collecting tolls.
MARGE
Twenty-five cents please. Twenty-
five cents please. Twenty-five cents
please (COUGHS A LITTLE).
Homer drives up.
MARGE
(CONT’D)
You can go through free.
HOMER
Woo hoo!
Homer speeds through the toll booth.

EXT. RESTAURANT PARKING LOT - AERIAL VIEW - NIGHT
We see Homer and Marge getting out of their car in the
parking lot of "The Spruce Caboose", a theme restaurant
made from the zigzagged cars of a derailed train, right
next to the train tracks.
INT. THE SPRUCE CABOOSE - CONTINUOUS
Homer and Marge enter. The place is loaded with railroad
wreckage. The MAITRE D’, holding menus and dressed as a
conductor, is talking to a family.
MAITRE
D’
It was the most beautiful, most
expensive train ever built, the
“Spruce Caboose".
He illustrates the rest of his talk with other photos.
MAITRE
D’ (CONT'D)
Some people said it was too big to
stay on the tracks... and they were
right. It derailed right here. Took
two years to get all the bodies out
of the wreckage. (POINTS TO GRISLY
TRAIN WRECK
PHOTO) But then, along
came Consolidated Food Service
Corporation, and the rest is history.
MARGE
We're here for the retirement party.
MAITRE
D’


Follow the Headless Brakeman.


A MAN
in a Headless Brakeman costume leads them out. He
BUMPS
into the wall a few times.

INT. THE SPRUCE CABOOSE - BOXCAR THREE - A MINUTE LATER


Homer and Marge approach a group of workers including
LENNY.


MARGE
I always feel so awkward at these
office parties. They’re all shop-
talk.

LENNY
(TO CO-WORKERS) So then I took this
long, roundy-like greenish thing,
kinda looked like a pickle, and stuck
it in the big thing with like, teeth.


SMITHERS, with BURNS beside him at the dais, bangs a spoon
on a glass.


BURNS
Tonight, we’ve all come to honor a
close friend of ours...

HOMER
Bo-ring!

BURNS
(FROWNING) A man who provided the
Burns Corporation with forty-five
years of faithful service, Mr. Jack
Marley.


Burns indicates a sad looking OLDER MAN at the table. We
DISSOLVE TO
scenes from their past.

9F05 TABLE DRAFT 4/21/92


BURNS
(V.0O.)
In 1947, Jack Marley, fresh out of
engineering school, came to me with a
plan, a plan to produce clean, safe
power at a low cost.


We SEE YOUNG BURNS and YOUNGER MARLEY, in zoot suits and
hats, holding a blueprint and smiling.


BURNS
(CONT’D V.O.)
But I shouted him down and decided
instead on nuclear power.
The two are standing in front of a small road side stand
with a sign "Burns and Marley Nuclear Power and Corn".
There is a hand cranked nuclear generator on the counter,
next to a bushel of corn.
BURNS
(CONT’D)
In 1960, our dreams became reality
when we opened our first power
station.
Burns pulls the switch. In the corner, we can see Marley’s
face straining to get into the frame. A big, hairy hand
keeps him out.
BURNS
(CONT’D)
Then, just as the money began rolling
in, Jack told me he wanted to be
kicked out of the executive suite and
become a working man again.
A gangster is holding a gun to Marley’s head, forcing hin
to sign papers. Burns, standing in background, looks on
with glee. Smithers can also be seen, painting over the


"Marley" in the sign.


DISSOLVE

BURNS
(CONT’D V.O.)
During the next few decades Jack
achieved inner peace.
Marley scrubbing a urinal. Burns WASHES his hands, and
dries them with a paper towel which he CRUMPLES and tosses
at Marley’s head.
BACK TO
SCENE
Burns sits down. The lights come back on. Homer is at the
banquet table eating the food from under the plastic wrap -
he scurries back to his seat like a cockroach.
SMITHERS
(CLEARING THROAT) Mr. Burns, if you
don’t mind, I’ve prepared a little
musical number for Jack’s special
night.
MARLEY
smiles weakly. Smithers CLAPS his hands. A line of
DANCING GIRLS
comes out from behind the curtain. The
MUSICAL NUMBER
is similar to the party scene from "Citizen
Kane".
SMITHERS
(SINGING) There is a man...
GIRLS
There is a man...
SMITHERS
A certain man...

A certain man...
SMITHERS
A man whose grace / And handsome face


/ Are known across the land! / You


know his name...


1S


9F05 TABLE DRAFT 4/21/92


The crowd has become excited. Even Marley looks happy.
SMITHERS
(CONT’D)
It’s Mister Burns!
The crowd goes silent. Marley returns to his regular glum
self. Burns lights up as the girls sashay over and tousle
his hair.
GIRLS
He’s Mister Burns!
SMITHERS
He loves a smoke
Enjoys a joke
BURNS
/ GIRLS
Ah ha~ha-ha-ha
SMITHERS
Why, he’s worth ten times what he
earns!
Burns is really enjoying himself.
GIRLS
He’s Mister Burns!
BURNS
(DELIGHTED) I’m Mister Burns!
SMITHERS
He’s Monty Burns!
BURNS.


(SUDDENLY STERNER) I’m Mister Burns!

9F05 TABLE DRAFT


SMITHERS
(BIG FINALE) To friends he’s known as
Monty, but to you it’s


Mister...BURNS!!


Burns YELLS "Bravo!" repeatedly. The crowd is still


4/21/92


completely silent, some of them stunned. The girls file


off.
MARLEY
Do you mind if I say a few words?
BURNS
oh, me, me, me "I need all the
attention just because it’s my
party!" (HOLDS UP HANDS IN IMPATIENT


"WELL, GO AHEAD" MANNER.)


Marley rises to speak. For a beat, he looks around the


room in silence.
MARLEY
Please don’t make me retire! My job
is the only thing that keeps me
alive! I never married, and my dog


is dead!


Burns cues the band to start PLAYING. A merry rendition of


"For He’s a Jolly Good Fellow" drowns Marley out.
MARLEY
(CONT’D)
I’m not finished.
BURNS


Oh, yes you are.


Burns cues several LARGE THUGS to carry Marley out of the


room.


9F05 TABLE DRAFT 4/21/92


EXT. THE SPRUCE CABOOSE - BOXCAR THREE - CONTINUOUS


The boxcar door slides open and Marley is tossed out onto
the railroad tracks. The door SLAMS shut.


INT. THE SPRUCE CABOOSE - BOXCAR THREE - CONTINUOUS


The music stops. A blast of FEEDBACK completely silences
the room.


BURNS
With the departure of Mr. Marley,
there will now be an entry-level
position open in Sector 7G. Now get
out. The bar is closed.

CROWD
(MOANS)

EXT. SIMPSON HOUSE - LATER THAT NIGHT


Marge and Homer are walking from the car to the slanted
house.


MARGE
Maybe I should apply for that job.
HOMER
Marge, you're talking about working
in a nuclear power plant. That takes
years and years of specialized
training.
MARGE
How much training did you have?
HOMER
If I remember correctly, this


conversation was about you.


16.


9F05 TABLE DRAFT 4/21/92


MARGE
(MURMUR)
HOMER
Forget it Marge. We already live
together; we shouldn’t work together.
As the Bible says "Thou shalt not
horn in on thy husband’s... racket."
MARGE
Where does the Bible....
HOMER
Look, Marge we just don’t need the
money that bad.
They reach the front door. CAMERA MOVES UP from the
diagonal door to the roof. A hummingbird flutters around
the chimney and comes to rest gently upon it. The house
shifts violently under the bird’s weight.

MARGE
Well, Lisa, I finished my resume.


She hands Lisa a piece of paper that says: "Marge Simpson,
Homemaker - 1980 - Present".


LISA
Uh...I think it needs a little
padding.


Lisa sits down and puts a new sheet in the typewriter and
starts TYPING FURIOUSLY.


MARGE
What are you putting...
LISA
Up-up-up. When I’m done.
Lisa finishes, pulls the paper out and hands it to Marge.
MARGE

Homer walks by in his underwear.

You’ve got a point there.

INT. POWER PLANT -

Smithers is looking through Marge’s resume.

SMITHERS
(IMPRESSED) Uh-huh... Uh-huh... I
thought Muddy Waters wrote that song.
This resume is very impressive, but
there’s one final question: Have you
ever been fired from a job at the
post office?

No.

(CHANGING SUBJECT) Look at that
headline: "Canada To Hold
Referendum." Sorry Marge, can’t talk
now.
MARGE
We need the money, and my life is
pretty boring. Usually the most
exciting part of my day is when the
cat brings in a bird that isn’t quite
dead. It flies around the house and I
have to chase it with a broom.
HOMER
There, see. You’ll be giving all
that up.
All the food on the table has slid over to Homer’s side and
is piled up in a stack. Homer sticks his fork into the
huge mass, pulls out a hamburger in a bun, looks pleasantly
surprised, and takes a bite.
LISA
I think it’s wonderful. Mom and Dad
side by side at the power plant.
You’1ll be just like Marie and Pierre

Nobody has to take care of us.

Grampa! He’s not fit to raise a
child. I mean, look at me.
INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - A FEW MINUTES LATER


Marge and Homer are leaving for work. Grampa is with the
kids.


GRAMPA
I dropped the ball with Homer. I
admit it. But this time I’m gonna do
it all by the book.

It has an engraving of a mustachioed man on it, and the
cover reads "Guide to Infantile Distress. Printed by Dr.
Washburn’s Asbestos Pills."

Marge, before we get there, I want to
tell you about the "Code of the
Workplace". If a guy’s not where


he’s supposed to be, tell the boss


he’s in the can... 15 minutes is only
the suggested coffee break... and


most importantly, if something goes
wrong, just blame the guy who can’t
speak English. (FONDLY) Ah, Tibor,
how many times have you saved my butt
(CHUCKLES) .

MARGE
I just thought I would give an honest
effort and take the blame for my
mistakes.


Homer SCREECHES the car to a halt and looks at Marge with
deadly seriousness.


HOMER
(QUIET INTENSITY) If I ever hear that
again I’m going to turn this car
right around.

You must be sick. Let’s see. What’s
old doc Washburn prescribe?
Grampa flips through his book.
GRAMPA
(CONT’D)
Do you have cholera? Croup? Dropsy?
The Grippe? Scrofula? Catarrh?
Maggie leaps at the bottle but doesn’t quite get it.
INT. POWER PLANT - HALLWAY - MORNING


Marge, with a hard-hat on top of her beehive, is getting a
tour from Smithers. He approaches a locked door.


SMITHERS
And this is your office. That idiot
Tibor lost the key, but you can jimmy
it open with a credit card.


Smithers jimmies the door open. A large machine with many
blinking lights and levers is inside.


SMITHERS
(CONT’D)
Well, have fun.
He starts to exit.
MARGE
But... what do I do?
SMITHERS
(CHUCKLES) Oh, Marge, please.
According to your resume, you
invented this machine.
Smithers exits. Marge stares forlornly at the machine.
She looks around to make sure no one’s watching, then


tentatively pushes a button. FOUR WORKERS run past her
door, followed by a COLUMN OF FLAME.

Homer and Marge sit at a table, with food and champagne on
the side, in front of a band shell. No one else is
present. TOM JONES is SINGING "It’s Not Unusual." We see
he is chained by the ankle to the floor. Tom loosens his
tie and tosses it in the audience. Marge catches it.
MARGE
(EXCITED) Homer, I caught his tie!
HOMER
Marge, we’re the only ones here.


They CHUCKLE. Tom Jones continues SINGING. FIREWORKS go
off in the sky behind the band shell.


FADE

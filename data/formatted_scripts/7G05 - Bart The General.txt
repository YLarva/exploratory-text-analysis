FADE
IN:
INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - INSIDE DARKENED OVEN -EARLY MORNING
CAMERA
is positioned in the back of the darkened oven,
looking out. The oven door opens enough for HOMER to peek
in. We see outline of cupcakes.
HOMER
(V.O.)
(SNIFFS) Do I smell cupcakes?


The oven door opens all the way, revealing Homer SMACKING
his lips.


HOMER
(V.O., CONT'D)
Do I ever!
MARGE
(V.0O.)
Uh-uh, Homer. Lisa's making those for
her teacher.
HOMER


Ah. Say no more.

Homer pulls his nose out of the oven and Marge's hand
gently closes the SQUEAKING door. It opens again reveal
Bart.
BART
Yum. Don't mind if I do!
Bart reaches for a cupcake.
MARGE
(V.O.)
Bart!


Marge's hand appears, grabs Bart by the scruff of the neck,
and drags him away from the oven. The oven door SHUTS.


LISA
(V.0.)
Keep your greasy mitts outta there.
BART
Oh, man.
MARGE
These are for Lisa's class.
LISA
It's Mrs. Hoover's birthday!

LISA
No there aren't.
BART
Teacher's pet, apple polisher, butt


kisser...

HOMER
Bart, you're saying butt kisser like
it's a bad thing.

BART
Huh?


Homer PATS his knee. Bart, confused, walks over to him and
sits on his knee.


HOMER
You see, boy. It never hurts to grease
the wheels a little.

LISA
I'm not greasing wheels, Dad. I like
my teacher.

HOMER
Surely, Lisa. (TO BART) You see how
it works, Bart? (GESTURING WITH
CUPCAKE) A cupcake here, a good grade
there.

LISA
Dad, I get good grades 'cause I'm smart
and I pay attention and I study hard.

HOMER
You're right, Lis. (TO BART) It's the
three roads to success, Bart. Work,
brains, and... (GESTURES WITH CUPCAKE)

Oh, brother.

BART
Uh oh, school bus! Gotta go.


Bart and Lisa dart out the door. Homer stands there
holding the cupcake. He looks at it.


HOMER
(CHUCKLES)
The door flies open, Lis


a re-enters, grabs the cupcake and exits in one smooth
motion.


HOMER
Damn.

TO:
INT. INSIDE OF SCHOOL BUS - A LITTLE LATER
Bart and Lisa are walking up the steps into the school bus.
Lisa is holding on carefully to her box of cupcakes. Bart
is watching the box closely. SFX: BUS ENGINE IDLING. Bart
and Lisa stop at the top of the steps to talk to OTTO, the
bus driver.
BART
Yo, Otto-man.
oTto
Yo, Bart-dude.
BART
Hey, can you believe it, man? My
sister has made a whole pile of
cupcakes to butter up her teacher, and


she won't give anybody else even one


measly little crumb!

oTTto
That's bad news, man.
LISA
Here, Otto, I made an extra one for
you.
Lisa hands a cupcake to Otto.
oTTo
Oh, thanks, little lady.
LISA
(PLEASED) You're welcome.
BART
(TO OTTO) Yet, how about giving me
half of that, man?


Otto starts to eat the cupcake and, without answering,
points to a sign reading "Do not talk to bus driver."


BART
This is the last time I ever worship a
bus driver.
NEW
ANGLE
Bart and Lisa walk a few steps down the aisle and then sit
down. The bus jerks into motion and Bart grabs onto one
end of the box of cupcakes. 68FX: BUS JOLTS INTO MOTION.
CLATTER OF A FEW LUNCH BOXES FALLING OFF SEATS. ONE OR TWO
SMALL MUFFLED

BART
(CONT'D)
Better let me hold these, Lis.
Bart tugs hopefully on his end of the box.
LISA


(SNAPPING) Forget it.

BART
(CONTEMPTUOUSLY) You teacher's pet!
You sniveling toad! You little egg
sucker!

LISA
Tell me more.

ART
(EXASPERATED GRUNT) Backscratcher!
Foot licker! Honor student!

LISA
(SMUGLY) You'll never get one now,
Mr. Name-caller.


Bart lets go of his end of the box, then wipes his forehead
and takes a deep breath.


BART
(CONT'D)
(THE VOICE OF REASON) All right, all
right. Look. I'm sorry. I got upset.
In the heat of the moment, I said some
things I didn't mean.

LISA
You weren't thinking, were you?

BART
No.

LISA
I'm not a sniveling toad, am I?

BART


Not really.


Final Delivery - 7/25/89 - Page 7.


LISA
I'm not a little egg sucker, am I?
BART
Of course not.
LISA
Then what am I?
BART
A beautiful human being.
LISA
(HAPPILY DRINKING ALL THIS IN) What do
you like best about me?
BART
Well, I'd have to say... your generous
nature, your spirit of giving.
Bart looks hopefully at the cupcakes and then at Lisa.
LISA
(UNCERTAIN) Well...
Lisa starts to open the box of cupcakes.
LISA
(CONT'D)
Open your mouth, and close your eyes,
and you will get a big surprise.
Bart does so. Lisa gets up to move to another seat. As
she picks up the box of cupcakes, one of them falls to the
floor. She reconsiders, and then puts the cupcake from the
floor into Bart's mouth.
BART
(MOUTHFUL) Thanks, Lis. You're the
best.

EXT. NEAR SCHOOL ENTRANCE - JUST BEFORE SCHOOL
Lisa and Bart are standing among a group of kids who have
gotten off their buses and are waiting for the school bell
to ring. Lisa opens her cupcake box and shows the contents
to a girlfriend, JANEY.
LISA
Look, Janey, cupcakes,
Janey looks into the box. Suddenly a small weasely
Peter Lorre-type KID (WEASEL #1) appears between the two
girls and grabs the box.
WEASEL
#1
(BRIEFLY) Gimme that!


Weasel #1 reaches into the box, pulls out a cupcake, eats
the frosting and throws the rest away.


LISA
Hey! Give those back!
Weasel #1 scrapes the frosting off a second cupcake with
his front teeth. Bart rushes INTO FRAME. He stops a
fraction of an inch from the Weasel and raises his fist.
BART
Hey, what's the big idea? That's my


sister, man!


Weasel #1 stands on his tip-toes to better sneer at Bart.
His mouth is still full of frosting.


WEASEL
#1
So what?

BART
So give her back those cupcakes before
I knock your block off.


Kids AD LIB: "All right!", "Do it!", "Yeah, Bart, do it!"
"Don't be afraid. Fight him. Knock his block off!"

Weasel #1 defiantly holds the box of cupcakes in front of
Bart and lets go. He then brings his foot down on the box,
causing frosting and cupcake matter to ooze out of the
sides SFX: CAKE-SQUISHING NOISES. Bart jumps on the
Weasel and starts swinging his arms violently. SFX:

SPORADICALLY.

CLOSEUP - BART AND WEASEL #1

Suddenly a grade-school-kid's huge hand comes INTO FRAME,
grabs Bart by the scruff of the neck and pulls him OUT OF
FRAME.

WIDER
SHOT

NELSON, the school bully, is holding Bart up in the air
with one hand. Bart is still swinging wildly, his eyes and
teeth clenched tight. He doesn't realize he's been picked
up. Bart unloads a powerful roundhouse that catches Nelson
square in the nose. SFX: PUNCH.


Nelson drops Bart to the ground with a THUMP and reaches
for his injured nose.


BART - ON
GROUND


He opens his eyes, flexes his slightly bruised hand, then
looks up, startled, at Nelson.


CLOSEUP -
NELSON
WEASEL
#1 (V.O.)
Nelson, you're bleeding.
NELSON
Nah. This happens all the time.
Somebody else's blood splatters on me.
He daubs at his nose and SNIFFS.
NELSON
(CONT'D)
Hey, wait a minute. You're right. (TO
BART) You made me bleed my own blood.
WIDER
SHOT


Bart is looking up at Nelson, horrified.


Final Delivery - 7/25/89 - Page 10.


The other kids are standing completely still, stunned by
what has happened.


BART
(SUDDENLY FRIGHTENED) It was an
ACCIDENT, man. A terrible ghastly
mistake! Ask anybody!


We PAN the crowd of kids. Everyone turns away from Bart.
The sky is darkened. SFX: WIND WHOOSH!


BART
Uh, oh. A cold wind!


PRINCIPAL SKINNER
strolls INTO FRAME and gives the scene a
casual glance.


SKINNER
Hello, kids. Everything above the
board here? Good. Play friendly,
children.
SFX: SCHOOL BELL


The BELL stings Principal Skinner into action. He starts
shooing all the kids towards the school entrance.


SKINNER
(CONT'D)
Uh, oh. There's your bell. Come along
now, all of you.


Principal Skinner turns Nelson around and shoos him towards
the entrance.


SKINNER
(CONT'D)
No dawdling, now.


Nelson walks away from Bart reluctantly, but turns his head
to glare back at Bart.

NELSON
(TO BART) I'll get you after school,
man.
BART
But...
Mr. Skinner starts shooing Bart towards the entrance.
SKINNER
No. He'll get you after school, son.
Now hurry up. It's time for class.

A FIST SMASHES
through the door. Bart backs away. A Six
foot muscular Nelson CRASHES the door down. Bart grabs a
handful of daggers. In machine-like fashion, he flings
them at Nelson. The knives stick in Nelson's chest. He
LAUGHS
and pulls them out, tossing them aside. Bart grabs
a MACHINE GUN and FIRES it at Nelson, who now appears about
ten feet tall. Nelson LAUGHS as the bullets bounce off his
chest. Bart throws the empty machine gun at Nelson who
grabs it and eats it.


INT. STAIRCASE -
CONTINUOUS
Bart starts to run up flight of stairs. Nelson's head
grows larger and larger outside the window, staying in pace
with Bart's running. Bart reaches the top of the stairs
and leans against the wall, PANTING. Suddenly, the room
closes around him. It is Nelson's hand. He is now fifty
feet tall. He holds Bart above his open mouth like a
sardine.
BART
Whew! Uh, oh!
NELSON
Hmmm. Lunchtime. Lunchtime. (LAUGHS)

But I can't squeal. It would violate
the code of the school yard.

LISA
(LOUD AND PROUD) Hey, everybody. Here
comes my brother, Bart the bully-
killer!

ALL AT THE
TABLE
Yay!!!


Space is quickly made at the table and Bart and Milhouse
sit down amidst hearty congratulations. Kids AD LIB:


"Nice going", "We're proud of you", "Keep it up", "Could I
have your autograph?" "You're a hero, Bart."
BART


Look, everybody. I would just as soon
not make a big deal out of this. I'm
not saying I'm not a hero. I'm just
saying that I fear for my safety.

Nelson and the WEASELS push their way through. The overall

Bart remain.

Bart, here's that cupcake you wanted.
I can't help but think if I had just
given it to you in the first place,

now, so I'll just place it lovingly on
your forehead. (LISA PLACES CUPCAKE ON

Bart is just a few feet from Nelson and the two grinning

Bart instantly shoots his hands straight up in the air in
surrender. Nelson begins throwing a series of quick lefts
and rights to Bart's head.

Each punch slightly changes the shape of Bart's head,
roughly the same effect of punching a beanbag. The final

Well, Bart, I hope you're going
straight to the principal about this.

What on earth are you talking about,


Homer?

anything unless you're sure everyone

Yeah, - he's chunkified, all right.

MARGE
And I'll bet he doesn't do well in his
studies either.

BART
No. He's pretty dumb. He's in all the
same special classes I am.

MARGE
Huh huh. And I'll bet he's not all
that attractive and doesn't make
friends easily. That's why he lashes
out at the world.

HOMER
Marge.

MARGE
So tomorrow, instead of bickering with
this boy, talk to him. You'll be
surprised how far a little
understanding will go.

Well, thank you very much, Mrs.

you're going to throw a punch, you

(STARTING TO UNDERSTAND) Yeah!
HOMER
And there's nothing wrong with hitting
someone when his back is turned.
BART
Gotcha.

INT. HERMAN'S ANTIQUE SHOP - CONTINUOUS
Bart follows Grandpa into the shop and looks around in
wonderment. The shop is littered with all sorts of
military memorabilia; medals, swords, flags, old WW II
newspapers, posters and proclamations. One poster shows
the earth as viewed from space totally engulfed in flames.
It says: "Because Somebody Talked". There are magazines
like "Borderline Psychotic Week", inflammatory pamphlets
("Fluoridation? Hell!") and small cutely printed signs
like "You Don't Have To Be Crazy To Work Here, But It
Helps". As he enters, Bart passes by a large bucket
labeled "Hitler Teeth - 50 cents each". Grandpa seems to
be quite at his ease in this shop, but Bart is a little
uncomfortable, and the store owner, Herman --a one-armed
borderline psychotic-- is eyeballing Bart suspiciously.
GRANDPA
(LOOKING AROUND) So Herman, has the
large-type edition of this month's copy
of Soldier of Fortune come in yet?
HERMAN
Not yet. (USING BEST SALES TECHNIQUE)
Can I interest you in some authentic
Nazi underpants?
GRANDPA
No. Actually, we mostly came over
because I want you to meet my grandson,
Bart.


Herman gives Bart a penetrating look. Bart hides a little
behind Grandpa's leg.


HERMAN
Hello, young American.
BART
Hello, sir. Mr. Herman, did you lose


your arm in the war?

HERMAN
My arm? Well, let me put it this way.
Next time your teacher tells you to
keep your arm inside the bus window,
you do it.
BART
Yes, sir. I will.
GRANDPA
Bart's got a problem with a local young
bully named Nelson. I thought you
could help him with some kind of
strategy.
HERMAN
(INTERESTED) Strategy? Hmmm. (TO
BART) How many men do you have?
BART
None.
HERMAN
You'll need more. And you'll need to
train them, hard. Now let's see...
Herman turns and rummages through a file drawer behind the
counter, then pulls out a large map. He unrolls it on the
counter, weights the end with a hand grenade and affixes a
corner with a bayonet still attached to a rifle. Then he


points at the center of it with his pencil. Bart and
Grandpa lean forward to see what he's pointing at.

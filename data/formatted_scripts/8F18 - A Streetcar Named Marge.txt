Inside the duct, Maggie crawls along until she’s looking Scene Us
down at Ms. Sinclair. Her keys are visible on the desk.

Maggie takes a Talking Krusty doll out of the diaper and (cord)
pulls the string. She quickly clamps it with a clothespin

so that Krusty doesn’t talk.


Maggie puts a "Barrel of Monkeys" nonkey on the ring at the
end of the string. Then, she carefully lowers the string
and hooks the keys with the plastic chimp. When she takes
off the clothespin, the string brings the keys up to her
waiting hands.

next to the office door. He hears the Krusty signal and
pushes off, sliding into the office door with enough force
to SLAM it shut. On impact, the doorknobs fall out and
CLANK
to the ground. Ms. Sinclair impotently hollers and
pounds on the door.

Maggie emerges at the other end of the duct. She produces
a toy gun and aims through the vent and fires a suction~
dart with a string attached at the locker. The dart
STICKS, and the gun pressed against the vent holds the
string at Maggie’s end. She hooks a kiddy coat hanger on
the string and rappels down to the locker, where she
unlocks the padlock, opens the locker, and takes out the
pacifier basket. Maggie throws handfuls of pacifiers to

Homer, Bart and Lisa enter the nursery dressed for the

The cumulative noise is deafening. Their passive staring
is very ominous and creepy.


As SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC plays, the Simpsons carefully step

crumpled papers, apple cores, old sandwiches (etc.). A

Sorry about the ruse, gentlemen.

SKINNER
Superintendent Chalmers! Welcome!
CHALMERS
Hello, Seymour.
SKINNER
So what’s the word down at One School
Board Plaza?
CHALMERS
We’re dropping the geography
requirement. The children weren’t
testing well. It was proving to be an
embarrassment.
SKINNER
Very good. Back to the three R’s.
CHALMERS


(CONFIDENTIALLY) Two R’s come October.

Skinner and Chalmers walk down the hallways. Banners read:
“Welcome Superintendent," and "We Love Chalmie."


SKINNER
(LEADING) What do you think of the
banners?
CHALMERS
Nothing but transparent toadying.
SKINNER
They were the children’s idea. I tried
to stop then.

Bart and the other troublemakers are sitting on the floor
glumly.

Science geeks not getting beat up...
kids using their lunch money for
food...

Alright!

SKINNER
May I interest you in a jello brick,

Well, I’m not made of stone.


He takes the jello brick. They sit at a table.
Chalmers takes a bite of meatloaf.


9F18 FINAL DELIVERY 9/25/92 8.


CHALMERS
(CONT’D)
Hm. This meatloaf tastes rather
grainy. You haven’t been stretching it
with low-cost meat extenders, have you?
SKINNER
Oh no, Sir. Even the Sloppy Joes are
neat as a pin.
INT. KITCHEN -

wife.

Willie kisses the tractor.

SCOTTISH WOMAN

Now there’s a lonely man.


A startled Willie looks up to see a pretty SCOTTISH WOMAN.
We hear:


MUSIC: "LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT"
SCOTTISH

(COYLY) I’m new in town. Be there a
cool loch where a lass could wash her


long red hair?


9F18 FINAL DELIVERY 9/25/92 9.


GROUNDSKEEPER
WILLIE
Nay, but there’s a pool at me apartment

children as smart as they look?
SKINNER
Well let’s pick one at random. How

SKINNER
(LAUGHS TOO HARD) Let’s go.


CHALMERS


Did that boy say what’s a battle?


SKINNER


No he said what’s that rattle. (UNDER


HIS
BREATH) It’s about the heating


duct.


EXT. SPRINGFIELD ELEM. -
WILLIE’S SHACK = DAY SCENE 5


A dirty, disheveled Bart runs past the tractor which is
idling unattended. After a beat, Bart comes back into
frame and stares at the tractor thoughtfully.


The lid on the tractor’s exhaust pipe FLAPS up and down


like a mouth.
EXHAUST PIPE
LID
Come on Bart. Ride me.
BART
(LOOKING AROUND) I better not.


The Exhaust Pipe Lid CLUCKS like a chicken.
down. He sees a chicken.


Bart looks

(SCREAMS)
EXT. SCHOOL YARD -
CONTINUOUS
We see the runaway tractor cutting a swath of destruction.
It flattens a row of bikes and then ROARS through a swing
set, narrowly missing each swinging child. Bart looks
terrified as the tractor races up and around a curved
baseball backstop.

BART

EXT. SPRINGFIELD ELEM. YARD - DAY


Chalmers takes a pinch of sand from the sandbox and tastes
it.


CHALMERS
Excellent. Not a trace of urine.


Chalmers throws a friendly arm around Skinner. They start
to stroll.


CHALMERS
(CONT’D)
Seymour, you run a tight ship.
SKINNER
Well, you know what they say, sir.
"Where there’s no smoke, there’s no


fire."


11.


9F18 FINAL DELIVERY 9/25/92


CHALMERS
What an odd remark.
We hear Bart’s TRACTOR approaching in the distance.
CHALMERS
(CONT’D)
(SEES SOMETHING ON GROUND) Why, that
looks like a fifty cent piece. I/11
just bend over and get it.
Chalmers bends over.
ANGLE ON
BART
He’s hanging on for dear life as the tractor heads for
Chalmers. The Superintendent’s rear end makes an inviting
target.
ANGLE ON
CHALMERS
As he struggles with the half dollar.
CHALMERS
(CONT’D)
(TO SELF) It seems to be caught between
these two flowers.
ANGLE ON
BART
He realizes a collision is imminent and leaps off the
tractor. Skinner reacts too late and the tractor plows
into Chalmer’s backside with a horrible MOWING SOUND.
SKINNER
(SCREAMS) NOOOOO!
EXT. BONNIE BRAE -

Groundskeeper Willie hears Skinner’s CRY and jerks up from
a torrid embrace. His face is covered with lipstick. A

Lunchlady Doris is bandaging a furious Chalmers. A worried
Bart and Skinner look on.


CHALMERS
Ow, Ow, ow. Seymour I was thinking of
promoting you to Assistant
Superintendent. But, instead, that
plum goes to Holloway.
SKINNER
No but sir, he’s a drunk.
CHALMERS,
And a pill popper.
SKINNER
If I could just...
CHALMERS
Silence! And why is a cafeteria worker
posing as a nurse?
LUNCHLADY
DORIS
I get two paychecks this way.
CHALMERS,
(ANNOYED GRUNT)
Skinner turns to Bart.
SKINNER
(COLD FURY) There’s no detention this
time, Simpson. This is the end. You
are expelled from Springfield

KENT BROCKMAN
(V.0O.)
In a tradition that dates back to
founding father Jebediah Springfield,
every May 10th local residents gather
to drive snakes into the center of town
and whack them to Snake Heaven.
We see old newsreel footage of SPRINGFIELDITES gathered
around the perimeter of town, then marching towards the
center of the town BANGING on pots and pans. Snakes flee
in front of them. When they get to the center, the men
start WHACKING all the snakes, although we do not see
snakes getting killed. The footage changes to a YOUNG
RICHARD NIXON
awkwardly wielding a stick and trying to
brain a snake that his secret servicemen have pinned to the
ground.
SUPER: 1949
KENT BROCKMAN
(V.0O.)
After exposing Alger Hiss, honorary
Grand Marshall Richard Nixon goes after
another deadly hiss.
Nixon takes careful aim and repeatedly WHACKS the secret
serviceman who is holding the snake down. Finally the
stick is taken away from Nixon and he is led away.
NIXON

EXT. SIMPSON
HOUSE
Lisa watches sadly as Homer leaps about the yard swinging
his stick. He spins, twirls and WHACKS with lightning
speed in all directions. He has the whole yard booby-
trapped with false snakes. They jump out at him and
SCREECH, like at the Disneyland Haunted House.
HOMER
(KUNG FU NOISES)
Homer flips end over end across the yard, WHACKING the
false snakes as they jump out at him. He spins, and KICKS
the garden hose out into the street.
LISA
(TRYING TO GET HIS ATTENTION)
Dad...Dad?
He almost hits her.
HOMER
Careful, I thought you were a snake.
LISA
Dad, everyone likes Whacking Day, but I


hate it. Is there something wrong with


me?


9F18 FINAL DELIVERY 9/25/92 28.


HOMER
(GENTLY) Yes, honey. Because you see,
the majority is always right. Whether
it’s their love for disco or, a year
later, their hate for disco.

LISA
So, what should I do?

HOMER
Just squeeze your rage into a bitter
little ball and release it at an
appropriate time. Like that day I hit
that referee with a whiskey bottle.
Remember that?

Lisa looks worried.

LISA
Yeah.

HOMER


Your Daddy hit the referee.


LISA
